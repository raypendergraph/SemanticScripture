            _Dacia_ was a large country bounded on the south by the _Danube_, on the
            east by the _Euxine_ sea, on the north by the river _Neister_ and the
            mountain _Crapac_, and on the west by the river _Tibesis_, or _Teys_, which
            runs southward into the _Danube_ a little above _Belgrade_. It comprehended
            the countries now called _Transylvania_, _Moldavia_, and _Wallachia_, and
            the eastern part of the upper _Hungary_. Its antient inhabitants were
            called _Getæ_ by the _Greeks_, _Daci_ by the _Latins_, and _Goths_ by
            themselves. _Alexander_ the great attacked them, and _Trajan_ conquered
            them, and reduced their country into a Province of the _Roman_ Empire: and
            thereby the propagation of the Gospel among them was much promoted. They
            were composed of several _Gothic_ nations, called _Ostrogoths_,
            _Visigoths_, _Vandals_, _Gepides_, _Lombards_, _Burgundians_, _Alans_, &amp;c.
            who all agreed in their manners, and spake the same language, as
            _Procopius_ represents. While they lived under the _Romans_, the _Goths_ or
            _Ostrogoths_ were seated in the eastern parts of _Dacia_, the _Vandals_ in
            the western part upon the river _Teys_, where the rivers _Maresh_ and
            _Keresh_ run into it. The _Visigoths_ were between them. The _Gepides_,
            according to _Jornandes_, were upon the _Vistula_. The _Burgundians_, a
            _Vandalic_ nation, were between the _Vistula_ and the southern fountain of
            the _Boristhenes_, at some distance from the mountain _Crapac_ northwards,
            where _Ptolemy_ places them, by the names of _Phrugundiones_ and
            _Burgiones_.[1] The _Alans_, another _Gothic_ nation, were between the
            northern fountain of the _Boristhenes_ and the mouth of the river _Tanais_,
            where _Ptolemy_ placeth the mountain _Alanus_, and western side of the
            _Palus Mæotis_.
          </p>
          <p id="98005003">
            These nations continued under the dominion of the _Romans_ till the second
            year of the Emperor _Philip_, and then for want of their military pay began
            to revolt; the _Ostrogoths_ setting up a kingdom, which, under their Kings
            _Ostrogotha_, _Cniva_, _Araric_, _Geperic_, and _Hermanaric_, increased
            till the year of Christ 376; and then by an incursion of the _Huns_ from
            beyond the _Tanais_, and the death of _Hermanaric_, brake into several
            smaller kingdoms. _Hunnimund_, the son of _Hermanaric_, became King over
            the _Ostrogoths_; _Fridigern_ over the _Visigoths_; _Winithar_, or
            _Vinithar_, over a part of the _Goths_ called _Gruthungi_ by _Ammian_,
            _Gothunni_ by _Claudian_, and _Sarmatæ_ and _Scythians_ by others:
            _Athanaric_ reign'd over another part of the _Goths_ in _Dacia_, called
            _Thervingi_; _Box_ over the _Antes_ in _Sarmatia_; and the _Gepides_ had
            also their King. The _Vandals_ fled over the _Danube_ from _Geberic_ in the
            latter end of the reign of _Constantine_ the great, and had seats granted
            them in _Pannonia_ by that Emperor, where they lived quietly forty years,
            viz. till the year 377, when several _Gothic_ nations flying from the
            _Hunns_ came over the _Danube_, and had seats granted them in _Mæsia_ and
            _Thrace_ by the _Greek_ Emperor _Valens_. But the next year they revolted,
            called in some _Goths_, _Alans_ and _Hunns_, from beyond the _Danube_, and
            routed the _Roman_ army, slew the Emperor _Valens_, and spread themselves
            into _Greece_ and _Pannonia_ as far as the _Alps_. In the years 379 and 380
            they were checkt by the arms of the Emperors _Gratian_ and _Theodosius_,
            and made a submissive peace; the _Visigoths_ and _Thervingi_ returned to
            their seats in _Mæsia_ and _Thrace_, the _Hunns_ retired over the _Danube_,
            and the _Alans_ and _Gruthingi_ obtained seats in _Pannonia_.
          </p>
          <p id="98005004">
            About the year 373, or 374, the _Burgundians_ rose from their seats upon
            the _Vistula_, with an army of eighty thousand men to invade _Gallia_; and
            being opposed, seated themselves upon the northern side of the _Rhine_ over
            against _Mentz_. In the year 358, a body of the _Salian Franks_, with their
            King, coming from the river _Sala_, were received into the Empire by the
            Emperor _Julian_, and seated in _Gallia_ between _Brabant_ and the _Rhine_:
            and their King _Mellobaudes_ was made _Comes domesticorum_, by the Emperor
            _Gratian_. _Richomer_, another noble _Salian Frank_, was made _Comes
            domesticorum_, and _Magister utriusque Militiæ_, by _Theodosius_; and A.C.
            384, was Consul with _Clearchus_. He was a great favourite of _Theodosius_,
            and accompanied him in his wars against _Eugenius_, but died in the
            expedition, and left a son called _Theudomir_, who afterwards became King
            of the _Salian Franks_ in _Brabant_. In the time of this war some _Franks_
            from beyond the _Rhine_ invaded _Gallia_ under the conduct of _Genobald_,
            _Marcomir_ and _Suno_, but were repulsed by _Stilico_; and _Marcomir_ being
            slain, was succeeded in _Germany_ by his son _Pharamond_.
          </p>
          <p id="98005005">
            While these nations remained quiet within the Empire, subject to the
            _Romans_, many others continued so beyond the _Danube_ till the death of
            the Emperor _Theodosius_, and then rose up in arms. For _Paulus Diaconus_
            in his _Historia Miscell._ _lib._ xiv. speaking of the times next after the
            death of this Emperor, tells us: _Eodem tempore erant Gothi &amp; aliæ gentes
            maximæ trans Danubium habitantes: ex quibus rationabiliores quatuor sunt,
            Gothi scilicet, Huisogothi, Gepides &amp; Vandali; &amp; nomen tantum &amp; nihil aliud
            mutantes. Isti sub Arcadia &amp; Honorio Danubium transeuntes, locati sunt in
            terra Romanorum: &amp; Gepides quidem, ex quibus postea divisi sunt Longobardi
            &amp; Avares, villas, quæ sunt circa Singidonum &amp; Sirmium, habitavere:_ and
            _Procopius_ in the beginning of his _Historia Vandalica_ writes to the same
            purpose. Hitherto the _Western Empire_ continued entire, but now brake into
            many kingdoms.
          </p>
          <p id="98005006">
            _Theodosius_ died A.C. 395; and then the _Visigoths_, under the conduct of
            _Alaric_ the successor of _Fridigern_, rose from their seats in _Thrace_
            and wasted _Macedon_, _Thessaly_, _Achaia_, _Peloponnesus_, and _Epirus_,
            with fire and sword for five years together; when turning westward, they
            invaded _Dalmatia_, _Illyricum_ and _Pannonia_; and from thence went into
            _Italy_ A.C. 402; and the next year were so beaten at _Pollentia_ and
            _Verona_, by _Stilico_ the commander of the forces of the _Western Empire_,
            that _Claudian_ calls the remainder of the forces of _Alaric_, _tanta ex
            gente reliquias breves_, and _Prudentius_, _Gentem deletam_. Thereupon
            _Alaric_ made peace with the Emperor, being so far humbled, that _Orosius_
            saith, he did, _pro pace optima &amp; quibuscunque sedibus suppliciter &amp;
            simpliciter orare_. This peace was ratified by mutual hostages; _Ætius_ was
            sent hostage to _Alaric_; and _Alaric_ continued a free Prince in the seats
            now granted to him.
          </p>
          <p id="98005007"> When _Alaric_ took up arms, the nations beyond the _Danube_ began to be in motion; and
            the next winter, between A.C. 395 and 396, a great body of _Hunns_, _Alans_,
            _Ostrogoths_, _Gepides_, and other northern nations, came over the frozen _Danube_,
            being invited by _Rufinus_: when their brethren, who had obtained seats within the
            Empire, took up arms also. _Jerome_ calls this great multitude, _Hunns_, _Alans_,
            _Vandals_, _Goths_, _Sarmatians_, _Quades_, and _Marcomans_; and saith, that they
            invaded all places between _Constantinople_ and the _Julian Alps_, wasting _Scythia_,
            _Thrace_, _Macedon_, _Dardania_, _Dacia_, _Thessaly_, _Achaia_, _Epirus_, _Dalmatia_,
            and all _Pannonia_. The _Suevians_ also invaded _Rhætia_: for when _Alaric_ ravaged
            _Pannonia_, the _Romans_ were defending _Rhætia_; which gave _Alaric_ an opportunity of
            invading _Italy_, as _Claudian_ thus mentions. <q lang="lat">
              <p id="98005008">_Non nisi perfidiâ nacti penetrabile tempus,_</p>
              <p id="98005009">
                _Irrupere Getæ, nostras dum Rhætia vires_</p>
              <p id="98005010"> _Occupat, atque alio desudant Marte cohortes_.</p>
            </q> And when
            _Alaric_ went from those parts into _Italy_, some other barbarous nations invaded
            _Noricum_ and _Vindelicia_, as the same Poet _Claudian_ thus writes: <q lang="lat">
              <p id="98005011">----_Jam foedera gentes_</p>
              <p id="98005012"> _Exuerant, Latiique auditâ clade feroces_<br/> _Vendelicos saltus &amp; Norica
            rura tenebant._ </p>
            </q>
          </p>
          <p id="98005013">
            This was in the years 402 and 403. And among these nations I reckon the
            _Suevians_, _Quades_, and _Marcomans_; for they were all in arms at this
            time. The _Quades_ and _Marcomans_ were _Suevian_ nations; and they and the
            _Suevians_ came originally from _Bohemia_, and the river _Suevus_ or
            _Sprake_ in _Lusatia_; and were now united under one common King called
            _Ermeric_, who soon after led them into _Gallia_. The _Vandals_ and _Alans_
            might also about this time extend themselves into _Noricum_. _Uldin_ also
            with a great body of _Hunns_ passed the _Danube_ about the time of
            _Chrysostom_'s banishment, that is, A.C. 404, and wasted _Thrace_ and
            _Mæsia_. _Radagaisus_, King of the _Gruthunni_ and succesor of _Winithar_,
            inviting over more barbarians from beyond the _Danube_, invaded _Italy_
            with an army of above two hundred thousand _Goths_; and within a year or
            two, A.C. 405 or 406., was overcome by _Stilico_, and perished with his
            army. In this war _Stilico_ was assisted with a great body of _Hunns_ and
            _Ostrogoths_, under the conduct of _Uldin_ and _Sarus_, who were hired by
            the Emperor _Honorius_. In all this confusion it was necessary for the
            _Lombards_ in _Pannonia_ to arm themselves in their own defence, and assert
            their liberty, the _Romans_ being no longer able to protect them.
          </p>
          <p id="98005014">
            And now _Stilico_ purposing to make himself Emperor, procured a military
            prefecture for _Alaric_, and sent him into the _East_ in the service of
            _Honorius_ the _Western_ Emperor, committing some _Roman_ troops to his
            conduct to strengthen his army of _Goths_, and promising to follow soon
            after with his own army. His pretence was to recover some regions of
            _Illyricum_, which the _Eastern_ Emperor was accused to detain injuriously
            from the _Western_; but his secret design was to make himself Emperor, by
            the assistance of the _Vandals_ and their allies: for he himself was a
            _Vandal_. For facilitating this design, he invited a great body of the
            barbarous nations to invade the _Western Empire_, while he and _Alaric_
            invaded the _Eastern_. And these nations under their several Kings, the
            _Vandals_ under _Godegisilus_, the _Alans_ in two bodies, the one under
            _Goar_, the other under _Resplendial_, and the _Suevians_, _Quades_, and
            _Marcomans_, under _Ermeric_, marched thro' _Rhætia_ to the side of the
            _Rhine_, leaving their seats in _Pannonia_ to the _Hunns_ and _Ostrogoths_,
            and joined the _Burgundians_ under _Gundicar_, and ruffled the _Franks_ in
            their further march. On the last of _December_ A.C. 406, they passed the
            _Rhine_ at _Ments_, and spread themselves into _Germania prima_ and the
            adjacent regions; and amongst other actions the _Vandals_ took _Triers_.
            Then they advanced into _Belgium_, and began to waste that country.
            Whereupon the _Salian Franks_ in _Brabant_ took up arms, and under the
            conduct of _Theudomir_, the son of _Ricimer_, or _Richomer_,
            abovementioned, made so stout a resistance, that they slew almost twenty
            thousand of the _Vandals_, with their King _Godegesilus_, in battel; the
            rest escaping only by a party of _Resplendial_'s _Alans_ which came timely
            to their assistance.
          </p>
          <p id="98005015">
            Then the _British_ soldiers, alarm'd by the rumour of these things,
            revolted, and set up Tyrants there; first _Marcus_, whom they slew
            presently; then _Gratian_, whom they slew within four months; and lastly
            _Constantine_, under whom they invaded _Gallia_ A.C. 408, being favoured by
            _Goar_ and _Gundicar_. And _Constantine_ having possessed a good part of
            _Gallia_, created his son _Constans Cæsar_, and sent him into _Spain_ to
            order his affairs there, A.C. 409.
          </p>
          <p id="98005016">
            In the mean time _Resplendial_, seeing the aforesaid disaster of the
            _Vandals_, and that _Goar_ was gone over to the _Romans_, led his army from
            the _Rhine_; and, together with the _Suevians_ and residue of the
            _Vandals_, went towards _Spain_; the _Franks_ in the mean time prosecuting
            their victory so far as to retake _Triers_, which after they had plundered
            they left to the _Romans_. The _Barbarians_ were at first stopt by the
            _Pyrenean_ mountains, which made them spread themselves into _Aquitain_:
            but the next year they had the passage betrayed by some soldiers of
            _Constans_; and entring _Spain_ 4 Kal. _Octob._ A.C. 409, they conquered
            every one what he could; and at length, A.C. 411, divided their conquests
            by lot; the _Vandals_ obtained _Boetica_, and part of _Gallæcia_; the
            _Suevians_ the rest of _Gallæcia_; and the _Alans_ _Lusitania_ and the
            _Carthaginian_ Province: the Emperor for the sake of peace confirming them
            in those seats by grant A.C. 413.
          </p>
          <p id="98005017">
            The _Roman Franks_ abovementioned, having made _Theudomir_ their King,
            began strait after their conquest of the _Vandals_ to invade their
            neighbours also. The first they set upon were the _Gauls_ of _Brabant_[2]:
            but meeting with notable resistance, they desired their alliance: and so
            those _Gauls_ fell off from the _Romans_, and made an intimate league with
            the _Franks_ to be as one people, marrying with one another, and conforming
            to one another's manners, till they became one without distinction. Thus by
            the access of these _Gauls_, and of the foreign _Franks_ also, who
            afterwards came over the _Rhine_, the _Salian_ kingdom soon grew very great
            and powerful.
          </p>
          <p id="98005018">
            _Stilico_'s expedition against the _Greek_ Emperor was stopt by the order
            of _Honorius_; and then _Alaric_ came out of _Epirus_ into _Noricum_, and
            requested a sum of money for his service. The Senate were inclined to deny
            him, but by _Stilico_'s mediation granted it. But after some time _Stilico_
            being accused of a traiterous conspiracy with _Alaric_, and slain 10 Kal.
            _Sept._ A.C. 408; _Alaric_ was thereby disappointed of his money, and
            reputed an enemy to the Empire; he then broke strait into _Italy_ with the
            army he brought out of _Epirus_, and sent to his brother _Adolphus_ to
            follow him with what forces he had in _Pannonia_, which were not great, but
            yet not to be despised. Thereupon _Honorius_ fearing to be shut up in
            _Rome_, retired to _Ravenna_ in _October_ A.C. 408. And from that time
            _Ravenna_ continued to be the seat of the _Western_ Emperors. In those days
            the _Hunns_ also invaded _Pannonia_; and seizing the deserted seats of the
            _Vandals_, _Alans_, and _Goths_, founded a new kingdom there. _Alaric_
            advancing to _Rome_ besieged it, and 9 Kal. _Sept._ A.C. 410 took it: and
            afterwards attempting to pass into _Africa_, was shipwrackt. After which
            _Honorius_ made peace with him, and got up an army to send against the
            Tyrant _Constantine_.
          </p>
          <p id="98005019">
            At the same time _Gerontius_, one of _Constantine_'s captains, revolted
            from him, and set up _Maximus_ Emperor in _Spain_. Whereupon _Constantine_
            sent _Edobec_, another of his captains, to draw to his assistance, the
            _Barbarians_ under _Goar_ and _Gundicar_ in _Gallia_, and supplies of
            _Franks_ and _Alemans_ from beyond the _Rhine_; and committed the custody
            of _Vienne_ in _Gallia Narbonensis_ to his son _Constans_. _Gerontius_
            advancing, first slew _Constans_ at _Vienne_, and then began to besiege
            _Constantine_ at _Arles_. But _Honorius_ at the same time sending
            _Constantius_ with an army on the same errand, _Gerontius_ fled, and
            _Constantius_ continued the siege, strengthned by the access of the
            greatest part of the soldiers of _Gerontius_. After four months siege,
            _Edobec_ having procured succours, the _Barbarian_ Kings at _Ments_, _Goar_
            and _Gundicar_, constitute _Jovinus_ Emperor, and together with him set
            forward to relieve _Arles_. At their approach _Constantius_ retired. They
            pursued, and he beat them by surprize; but not prosecuting his victory, the
            _Barbarians_ soon recovered themselves; yet not so as to hinder the fall of
            the tyrants _Constantine_, _Jovinus_ and _Maximus_. _Britain_ could not be
            recovered to the Empire, but remained ever after a distinct kingdom.
          </p>
          <p id="98005020">
            The next year, A.C. 412, the _Visigoths_ being beaten in _Italy_, had
            _Aquitain_ granted them to retire into: and they invaded it with much
            violence, causing the _Alans_ and _Burgundians_ to retreat, who were then
            depopulating of it. At the same time the _Burgundians_ were brought to
            peace; and the Emperor granted them for inheritance a region upon the
            _Rhine_ which they had invaded: and the same, I presume, he did with the
            _Alans_. But the _Franks_ not long after retaking and burning _Triers_,
            _Castinus_, A.C. 415, was sent against them with an army, who routed them
            and slew _Theudomir_ their King This was the second taking of _Triers_ by
            the _Franks_. It was therefore taken four times, once by the _Vandals_ and
            thrice by the _Franks_. _Theudomir_ was succeeded by _Pharamond_, the
            Prince or King of the _Salian Franks_ in _Germany_. From thence he brought
            new forces, reigned over the whole, and had seats granted to his people
            within the Empire near the _Rhine_.

          <p id="98005021"> And now the _Barbarians_ were all quieted, and settled in several kingdoms within the
            Empire, not only by conquest, but also by the grants of the Emperor _Honorius_. For
            _Rutilius_ in his _Itinerary_, written in Autumn, _Anno Urbis_ 1169, that is, according
            to _Varro_'s computation then in use, A.C. 416, thus laments the wasted fields: <q lang="lat">
              _Illa quidem longis nimium deformia bellis_;</q> And then adds, <q lang="lat"> _Jam
            tempus laceris post longa incendia fundis_
              _Vel pastorales ædificare casas._ </q> And a little after, <q lang="lat">
              _Æternum tibi Rhenus aret._
            </q>
          </p>
          <p id="98005022"> And _Orosius_ in the end of his history, which was finished A.C. 417, represents now a
            general pacification of the barbarous nations by the words<q lang="lat" inline="true">
            _comprimere_, _coangustare_, _addicere gentes immanissimas_; terming them
              _imperio addictas_</q>, because they had obtained seats in the Empire by league and
            compact; and <q lang="lat" inline="true">_coangustatas_</q>, because they did no longer
            invade all regions at pleasure, but by the same compact remained quiet in the seats then
            granted them. And these are the kingdoms, of which the feet of the Image were
            henceforward composed, and which are represented by iron and clay intermixed, which did
            not stick one to another, and were of different strength. </p>
