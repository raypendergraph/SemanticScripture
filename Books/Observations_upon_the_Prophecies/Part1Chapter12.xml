            The kingdoms represented by the second and third Beasts, or the Bear and
            Leopard, are again described by _Daniel_ in his last Prophecy written in
            the third year of _Cyrus_ over _Babylon_, the year in which he conquered
            _Persia_. For this Prophecy is a commentary upon the Vision of the Ram and
            He-Goat.

            _Behold_, saith [1] he, _there shall stand up yet three kings in _Persia__,
            [_Cyrus_, _Cambyses_, and _Darius Hystaspes_] _and the fourth_ [_Xerxes_]
            _shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength thro' his riches he
            shall stir up all against the realm of _Grecia_. And a mighty king_
            [_Alexander_ the great] _shall stand up, that shall rule with great
            dominion, and do according to his will. And when he shall stand up, his
            kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided towards the four winds of
            heaven; and not to his posterity_ [but after their death,] _nor according
            to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be pluckt up, even
            for others besides those_. _Alexander_ the great having conquered all the
            _Persian_ Empire, and some part of _India_, died at _Babylon_ a month
            before the summer Solstice, in the year of _Nabonassar_ 425: and his
            captains gave the monarchy to his bastard brother _Philip Aridæus_, a man
            disturbed in his understanding; and made _Perdiccas_ administrator of the
            kingdom. _Perdiccas_ with their consent made _Meleager_ commander of the
            army, _Seleucus_ master of the horse, _Craterus_ treasurer of the kingdom,
            _Antipater_ governor of _Macedon_ and _Greece_, _Ptolemy_ governor of
            _Egypt_; _Antigonus_ governor of _Pamphylia_, _Lycia_, _Lycaonia_, and
            _Phrygia major_; _Lysimachus_ governor of _Thrace_, and other captains
            governors of other Provinces; as many as had been so before in the days of
            _Alexander_ the great. The _Babylonians_ began now to count by a new _Æra_,
            which they called the _Æra_ of _Philip_, using the years of _Nabonassar_,
            and reckoning the 425th year of _Nabonassar_ to be the first year of
            _Philip_. _Roxana_ the wife of _Alexander_ being left big with child, and
            about three or four months after brought to bed of a son, they called him
            _Alexander_, saluted him King, and joined him with _Philip_, whom they had
            before placed in the throne. _Philip_ reigned three years under the
            administratorship of _Perdiccas_, two years more under the
            administratorship of _Antipater_, and above a year more under that of
            _Polyperchon_; in all six years and four months; and then was slain with
            his Queen _Eurydice_ in _September_ by the command of _Olympias_ the mother
            of _Alexander_ the great. The _Greeks_ being disgusted at the cruelties of
            _Olympias_, revolted to _Cassander_ the son and successor of _Antipater_.
            _Cassander_ affecting the dominion of _Greece_, slew _Olympias_; and soon
            after shut up the young king _Alexander_, with his mother _Roxana_, in the
            castle of _Amphipolis_, under the charge of _Glaucias_, _An. Nabonass._
            432. The next year _Ptolemy_, _Cassander_ and _Lysimachus_, by means of
            _Seleucus_, form'd a league against _Antigonus_; and after certain wars
            made peace with him, _An. Nabonass._ 438, upon these conditions: that
            _Cassander_ should command the forces of _Europe_ till _Alexander_ the son
            of _Roxana_ came to age; and that _Lysimachus_ should govern _Thrace_,
            _Ptolemy_ _Egypt_ and _Lybia_, and _Antigonus_ all _Asia_. _Seleucus_ had
            possest himself of _Mesopotamia_, _Babylonia_, _Sustana_ and _Media_, the
            year before. About three years after _Alexander_'s death he was made
            governor of _Babylon_ by _Antipater_; then was expelled by _Antigonus_; but
            now he recovered and enlarged his government over a great part of the
            _East_: which gave occasion to a new _Æra_, called _Æra Seleucidarum_. Not
            long after the peace made with _Antigonus_, _Diodorus_ saith the same
            _Olympic_ year; _Cassander_, seeing that _Alexander_ the son of _Roxana_
            grew up, and that it was discoursed thro'out _Macedonia_ that it was fit he
            should be set at liberty, and take upon him the government of his father's
            kingdom, commanded _Glaucias_ the governor of the castle to kill _Roxana_
            and the young king _Alexander_ her son, and conceal their deaths. Then
            _Polyperchon_ set up _Hercules_, the son of _Alexander_ the great by
            _Barsinè_, to be king; and soon after, at the sollicitation of _Cassander_,
            caused him to be slain. Soon after that, upon a great victory at sea got by
            _Demetrius_ the son of _Antigonus_ over _Ptolemy_, _Antigonus_ took upon
            himself the title of king, and gave the same title to his son. This was
            _An. Nabonass._ 441. After his example, _Seleucus_, _Cassander_,
            _Lysimachus_ and _Ptolemy_, took upon themselves the title and dignity of
            kings, having abstained from this honour while there remained any of
            _Alexander_'s race to inherit the crown. Thus the monarchy of the _Greeks_
            for want of an heir was broken into several kingdoms; four of which, seated
            _to the four winds of heaven_, were very eminent. For _Ptolemy_ reigned
            over _Egypt_, _Lybia_ and _Ethiopia_; _Antigonus_ over _Syria_ and the
            lesser _Asia_; _Lysimachus_ over _Thrace_; and _Cassander_ over _Macedon_,
            _Greece_ and _Epirus_, as above.
          </p>
          <p id="98012004">
            _Seleucus_ at this time reigned over the nations which were beyond
            _Euphrates_, and belonged to the bodies of the two first Beasts; but after
            six years he conquered _Antigonus_, and thereby became possest of one of
            the four kingdoms. For _Cassander_ being afraid of the power of
            _Antigonus_, combined with _Lysimachus_, _Ptolemy_ and _Seleucus_, against
            him: and while _Lysimachus_ invaded the parts of _Asia_ next the
            _Hellespont_, _Ptolemy_ subdued _Phoenicia_ and _Coelosyria_, with the
            sea-coasts of _Asia_.
          </p>
          <p id="98012005">
            _Seleucus_ came down with a powerful army into _Cappadocia_, and joining
            the confederate forces, fought _Antigonus_ in _Phrygia_ and flew him, and
            seized his kingdom, _An. Nabonass._ 447. After which _Seleucus_ built
            _Antioch_, _Seleucia_, _Laodicea_, _Apamea_, _Berrhæa_, _Edessa_, and other
            cities in _Syria_ and _Asia_; and in them granted the _Jews_ equal
            privileges with the _Greeks_.
          </p>
          <p id="98012006">
            _Demetrius_ the son of _Antigonus_ retained but a small part of his
            father's dominions, and at length lost _Cyprus_ to _Ptolemy_; but
            afterwards killing _Alexander_, the son and successor of _Cassander_ king
            of _Macedon_, he seized his kingdom, _An. Nabonass._ 454. Sometime after,
            preparing a very great army to recover his father's dominions in _Asia_;
            _Seleucus_, _Ptolemy_, _Lysimachus_ and _Pyrrhus_ king of _Epirus_,
            combined against him; and _Pyrrhus_ invading _Macedon_, corrupted the army
            of _Demetrius_, put him to flight, seized his kingdom, and shared it with
            _Lysimachus_. After seven months, _Lysimachus_ beating _Pyrrhus_, took
            _Macedon_ from him, and held it five years and a half, uniting the kingdoms
            of _Macedon_ and _Thrace_. _Lysimachus_ in his wars with _Antigonus_ and
            _Demetrius_, had taken from them _Caria_, _Lydia_, and _Phrygia_; and had a
            treasury in _Pergamus_, a castle on the top of a conical hill in _Phrygia_,
            by the river _Caicus_, the custody of which he had committed to one
            _Philetærus_, who was at first faithful to him, but in the last year of his
            reign revolted. For _Lysimachus_, having at the instigation of his wife
            _Arsinoe_, slain first his own son _Agathocles_, and then several that
            lamented him; the wife of _Agathocles_ fled with her children and brothers,
            and some others of their friends, and sollicited _Seleucus_ to make war
            upon _Lysimachus_; whereupon _Philetærus_ also, who grieved at the death of
            _Agathocles_, and was accused thereof by _Arsinoe_, took up arms, and sided
            with _Seleucus_. On this occasion _Seleucus_ and _Lysimachus_ met and
            fought in _Phrygia_; and _Lysimachus_ being slain in the battel, lost his
            kingdom to _Seleucus_, _An. Nabonass._ 465. Thus the Empire of the
            _Greeks_, which at first brake into four kingdoms, became now reduced into
            two notable ones, henceforward called by _Daniel_ the kings of the _South_
            and _North_. For _Ptolemy_ now reigned over _Egypt_, _Lybia_, _Ethiopia_,
            _Arabia_, _Phoenicia_, _Coelosyria_, and _Cyprus_; and _Seleucus_, having
            united three of the four kingdoms, had a dominion scarce inferior to that
            of the _Persian_ Empire, conquered by _Alexander_ the great. All which is
            thus represented by _Daniel_:[2] _And the king of the_ South [_Ptolemy_]
            _shall be strong, and one of his Princes_ [_Seleucus_, one of _Alexander_'s
            Princes] _shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall
            be a great dominion_.
          </p>
          <p id="98012007">
            After _Seleucus_ had reigned seven months over _Macedon_, _Greece_,
            _Thrace_, _Asia_, _Syria_, _Babylonia_, _Media_, and all the _East_ as far
            as _India_; _Ptolemy Ceraunus_, the younger brother of _Ptolemy
            Philadelphus_ king of _Egypt_, slew him treacherously, and seized his
            dominions in _Europe_: while _Antiochus Soter_, the son of _Seleucus_,
            succeeded his father in _Asia_, _Syria_, and most of the _East_; and after
            nineteen or twenty years was succeeded by his son _Antiochus Theos_; who
            having a lasting war with _Ptolemy Philadelphus_, at length composed the
            same by marrying _Berenice_ the daughter of _Philadelphus_: but after a
            reign of fifteen years, his first wife _Laodice_ poisoned him, and set her
            son _Seleucus Callinicus_ upon the throne. _Callinicus_ in the beginning of
            his reign, by the impulse of his mother _Laodice_, besieged _Berenice_ in
            _Daphne_ near _Antioch_, and slew her with her young son and many of her
            women. Whereupon _Ptolemy Euergetes_, the son and successor of
            _Philadelphus_, made war upon _Callinicus_; took from him _Phoenicia_,
            _Syria_, _Cilicia_, _Mesopotamia_, _Babylonia_, _Sustana_, and some other
            regions; and carried back into _Egypt_ 40000 talents of silver, and 2500
            images of the Gods, amongst which were the Gods of _Egypt_ carried away by
            _Cambyses_. _Antiochus Hierax_ at first assisted his brother _Callinicus_,
            but afterwards contended with him for _Asia_. In the mean time _Eumenes_
            governor of _Pergamus_ beat _Antiochus_, and took from them both all _Asia_
            westward of mount _Taurus_. This was in the fifth year of _Callinicus_, who
            after an inglorious reign of 20 years was succeeded by his son _Seleucus
            Ceraunus_; and _Euergetes_ after four years more, _An. Nabonass._ 527, was
            succeeded by his son _Ptolemy Philopator_. All which is thus signified by
            _Daniel_:[3] _And in the end of years they_ [the kings of the _South_ and
            _North_] _shall join themselves together: for the king's daughter of the_
            South [_Berenice_] _shall come to the king of the _North_ to make an
            agreement, but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall she
            stand, nor her seed, but she shall be delivered up, and he_ [_Callinicus_]
            _that brought her, and he whom she brought forth, and they that strengthned
            her in_ [those] _times_, [or defended her in the siege of _Daphne_.] _But
            out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his seat_ [her brother
            _Euergetes_] _who shall come with an army, and shall enter into the
            fortress_ [or fenced cities] _of the king of the _North_, and shall act
            against them and prevail: and shall carry captives into _Egypt_, their Gods
            with their Princes and precious vessels of silver and gold; and he shall
            continue some years after the king of the_ North.
          </p>
          <p id="98012008">
            _Seleucus Ceraunus_, inheriting the remains of his father's kingdom, and
            thinking to recover the rest, raised a great army against the governor of
            _Pergamus_, now King thereof, but died in the third year of his reign. His
            brother and successor, _Antiochus Magnus_, carrying on the war, took from
            the King of _Pergamus_ almost all the lesser _Asia_, recovering also the
            Provinces of _Media_, _Persia_ and _Babylonia_, from the governors who had
            revolted: and in the fifth year of his reign invading _Coelosyria_, he with
            little opposition possest himself of a good part thereof; and the next year
            returning to invade the rest of _Coelosyria_ and _Phoenicia_, beat the army
            of _Ptolemy Philopator_ near _Berytus_; he then invaded _Palestine_ and the
            neighbouring parts of _Arabia_, and the third year returned with an army of
            78000: but _Ptolemy_ coming out of _Egypt_ with an army of 75000, fought
            and routed him at _Raphia_ near _Gaza_, between _Palestine_ and _Egypt_;
            and recovered all _Phoenicia_ and _Coelosyria_, _Ann. Nabonass._ 532. Being
            puffed up with this victory, and living in all manner of luxury, the
            _Egyptians_ revolted, and had wars with him, but were overcome; and in the
            broils sixty thousand _Egyptian Jews_ were slain. All which is thus
            described by _Daniel_: [4] _But his sons_ [_Seleucus Ceraunus_, and
            _Antiochus Magnus_, the sons of _Callinicus_] _shall be stirred up, and
            shall gather a great army; and he_ [_Antiochus Magnus_] _shall come
            effectually and overflow, and pass thro' and return, and_ [again the next
            year] _be stirred up_ [marching even] _to his fortress_, [the frontier
            towns of _Egypt_;] _and the King of the _South_ shall be moved with choler,
            and come forth_ [the third year] _and fight with him, even with the King of
            the _North_; and he_ [the King of the _North_] _shall lead forth a great
            multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand. And the
            multitude being taken away, his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast
            down many ten thousands; but he shall not be strengthned by it: for the
            king of the _North_ shall return_, &amp;c.
          </p>
          <p id="98012009">
            About twelve years after the battle between _Philopator_ and _Antiochus_,
            _Philopator_ died; and left his kingdom to his young son _Ptolemy
            Epiphanes_, a child of five years old. Thereupon _Antiochus Magnus_
            confederated with _Philip_ king of _Macedon_, that they should each invade
            the dominions of _Epiphanes_ which lay next to them. Hence arose a various
            war between _Antiochus_ and _Epiphanes_, each of them seizing _Phoenicia_
            and _Coelosyria_ by turns; whereby those countries were much afflicted by
            both parties. First _Antiochus_ seized them; then one _Scopas_ being sent
            with the army of _Egypt_, recovered them from _Antiochus_: the next year,
            _An. Nabonass._ 550, _Antiochus_ fought and routed _Scopas_ near the
            fountains of _Jordan_, besieged him in _Sidon_, took the city, and
            recovered _Syria_ and _Phoenicia_ from _Egypt_, the _Jews_ coming over to
            him voluntarily. But about three years after, preparing for a war against
            the _Romans_, he came to _Raphia_ on the borders of _Egypt_; made peace
            with _Epiphanes_, and gave him his daughter _Cleopatra_: next autumn he
            passed the _Hellespont_ to invade the cities of _Greece_ under the _Roman_
            protection, and took some of them; but was beaten by the _Romans_ the
            summer following, and forced to return back with his army into _Asia_.
            Before the end of the year the fleet of _Antiochus_ was beaten by the fleet
            of the _Romans_ near _Phocæa_: and at the same time _Epiphanes_ and
            _Cleopatra_ sent an embassy to _Rome_ to congratulate the _Romans_ on their
            success against their father _Antiochus_, and to exhort them to prosecute
            the war against him into _Asia_. The _Romans_ beat _Antiochus_ again at sea
            near _Ephesus_, past their army over the _Hellespont_, and obtain'd a great
            victory over him by land, took from him all _Asia_ westward of mount
            _Taurus_, gave it to the King of _Pergamus_ who assisted them in the war;
            and imposed a large tribute upon _Antiochus_. Thus the King of _Pergamus_,
            by the power of the _Romans_, recovered what _Antiochus_ had taken from
            him; and _Antiochus_ retiring into the remainder of his kingdom, was slain
            two years after by the _Persians_, as he was robbing the Temple of _Jupiter
            Belus_ in _Elymais_, to raise money for the _Romans_. All which is thus
            described by _Daniel_. [5] _For the King of the_ North [_Antiochus_] _shall
            return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and shall
            certainly come, after certain years, with a great army and with much
            riches. And in those times there shall many stand up against the King of
            the_ South, [particularly the _Macedonians_;] _also the robbers of thy
            people_ [the _Samaritans_, &amp;c.] _shall exalt themselves to establish the
            vision, but they shall fall. So the King of the _North_ shall come, and
            cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities; and the arms of the
            _South_ shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there
            he any strength to withstand. But he that cometh against him shall do
            according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall
            stand in the glorious land, which shall fail in his hand. He shall also set
            his face to go with the strength_ [or army] _of all his kingdom, and make
            an agreement with him_ [at _Raphia_;] _and he shall give him the daughter
            of women corrupting her; but she shall not stand his side, neither be for
            him. After this he shall turn his face unto the Isles, and shall take many:
            but a Prince for his own behalf_ [the _Romans_] _shall cause the reproach
            offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn
            upon him. Then he shall turn his face towards the fort of his own land: but
            he shall stumble and fall, and not be found._
          </p>
          <p id="98012010">
            _Seleucus Philopator_ succeeded his father _Antiochus_, _Anno Nabonass._
            561, and reigned twelve years, but did nothing memorable, being sluggish,
            and intent upon raising money for the _Romans_ to whom he was tributary. He
            was slain by _Heliodorus_, whom he had sent to rob the Temple of
            _Jerusalem_. _Daniel_ thus describes his reign. [6] _Then shall stand up in
            his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom, but within few
            days be shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle._

            A little before the death of _Philopator_, his son _Demetrius_ was sent
            hostage to _Rome_, in the place of _Antiochus Epiphanes_, the brother of
            _Philopator_; and _Antiochus_ was at _Athens_ in his way home from _Rome_,
            when _Philopator_ died: whereupon _Heliodorus_ the treasurer of the
            kingdom, stept into the throne. But _Antiochus_ so managed his affairs,
            that the _Romans_ kept _Demetrius_ at _Rome_; and their ally the King of
            _Pergamus_ expelled _Heliodorus_, and placed _Antiochus_ in the throne,
            while _Demetrius_ the right heir remained an hostage at _Rome_. _Antiochus_
            being thus made King by the friendship of the King of _Pergamus_ reigned
            powerfully over _Syria_ and the neighbouring nations: but carried himself
            much below his dignity, stealing privately out of his palace, rambling up
            and down the city in disguise with one or two of his companions; conversing
            and drinking with people of the lowest rank, foreigners and strangers;
            frequenting the meetings of dissolute persons to feast and revel; clothing
            himself like the _Roman_ candidates and officers, acting their parts like a
            mimick, and in publick festivals jesting and dancing with servants and
            light people, exposing himself by all manner of ridiculous gestures. This
            conduct made some take him for a madman, and call him _Antiochus_ [Greek:
            Epimenês]. In the first year of his reign he deposed _Onias_ the
            high-Priest, and sold the high-Priesthood to _Jason_ the younger brother of
            _Onias_: for _Jason_ had promised to give him 440 talents of silver for
            that office, and 15 more for a licence to erect a place of exercise for the
            training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen; which licence was
            granted by the King, and put in execution by _Jason_. Then the King sending
            one _Apollonius_ into _Egypt_ to the coronation of _Ptolemy Philometor_,
            the young son of _Philometor_ and _Cleopatra_, and knowing _Philometor_ not
            to be well affected to his affairs in _Phoenicia_, provided for his own
            safety in those parts; and for that end came to _Joppa_ and _Jerusalem_,
            where he was honourably received; from thence he went in like manner with
            his little army to the cities of _Phoenicia_, to establish himself against
            _Egypt_, by courting the people, and distributing extraordinary favours
            amongst them. All which is thus represented by _Daniel_. [7] _And in his_
            [_Philometor_'s] _estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they_ [the
            _Syrians_ who set up _Heliodorus_] _shall not give the honour of the
            kingdom. Yet he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by
            flatteries_ [made principally to the King of _Pergamus_;] _and the arms_
            [which in favour of _Heliodorus_ oppose him] _shall be overflowed with a
            food from before him, and be broken; yea also_ [_Onias_ the high-Priest]
            _the Prince of the covenant. And after the league made with him,_ [the King
            of _Egypt_, by sending _Apollonius_ to his coronation] _he shall work
            deceitfully_ [against the King of _Egypt_,] _for he shall come up and shall
            become strong_ [in _Phoenicia _] _with a small people. And he shall enter
            into the quiet and plentiful cities of the Province_ [of _Phoenicia_;]
            _and_ [to ingratiate himself with the _Jews_ of _Phoenicia_ and _Egypt_,
            and with their friends] _he shall do that which his fathers have not done,
            nor his fathers fathers: he shall scatter among them the prey and the
            spoil, and the riches_ [exacted from other places;] _and shall forecast his
            devices against the strong holds_ [of _Egypt_] _even for a time._
          </p>
          <p id="98012012">
            These things were done in the first year of his reign, _An. Nabonass._ 573.
            And thenceforward he forecast his devices against the strong holds of
            _Egypt_, until the sixth year. For three years after, that is in the fourth
            year of his reign, _Menelaus_ bought the high-Priesthood from _Jason_, but
            not paying the price was sent for by the King; and the King, before he
            could hear the cause, went into _Cilicia_ to appease a sedition there, and
            left _Andronicus_ his deputy at _Antioch_; in the mean time the brother of
            _Menelaus_, to make up the money, conveyed several vessels out of the
            Temple, selling some of them at _Tyre_, and sending others to _Andronicus_.
            When _Menelaus_ was reproved for this by _Onias_, he caused _Onias_ to be
            slain by _Andronicus_: for which fact the King at his return from _Cilicia_
            caused _Andronicus_ to be put to death. Then _Antiochus_ prepared his
            second expedition against _Egypt_, which he performed in the sixth year of
            his reign, _An. Nabonass._ 578: for upon the death of _Cleopatra_, the
            governors of her son the young King of _Egypt_ claimed _Phoenicia_ and
            _Coelosyria_ from him as her dowry; and to recover those countries raised a
            great army. _Antiochus_ considering that his father had not quitted the
            possession of those countries[8], denied they were her dowry; and with
            another great army met and fought the _Egyptians_ on the borders of
            _Egypt_, between _Pelusium_ and the mountain _Casius_. He there beat them,
            and might have destroyed their whole army, but that he rode up and down,
            commanding his soldiers not to kill them, but to take them alive: by which
            humanity he gained _Pelusium_, and soon after all _Egypt_; entring it with
            a vast multitude of foot and chariots, elephants and horsemen, and a great
            navy. Then seizing the cities of _Egypt_ as a friend, he marched to
            _Memphis_, laid the whole blame of the war upon _Eulæus_ the King's
            governor, entred into outward friendship with the young King, and took upon
            him to order the affairs of the kingdom. While _Aniochus_ was thus
            employ'd, a report being spread in _Phoenicia_ that he was dead, _Jason_ to
            recover the high-Priesthood assaulted _Jerusalem_ with above a thousand
            men, and took the city: hereupon the King thinking _Judea_ had revolted,
            came out of _Egypt_ in a furious manner, re-took the city, slew forty
            thousand of the people, made as many prisoners, and sold them to raise
            money; went into the Temple, spoiled it of its treasures, ornaments,
            utensils, and vessels of gold and silver, amounting to 1800 talents; and
            carried all away to _Antioch_. This was done in the year of _Nabonassar_
            578, and is thus described by _Daniel_. [9] _And he shall stir up his
            power, and his courage against the King of the _South_ with a great army;
            and the King of the _South_ shall be stirrd up to battle with a very great
            and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they_, even _Antiochus_ and
            his friends, _shall forecast devices against him_, as is represented above;
            _yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat, shall_ betray and _destroy
            him, and his army shall be overthrown, and many shall fall down slain. And
            both these Kings hearts shall be to do mischief; and they_, being now made
            friends, _shall speak lyes at one table_, against the _Jews_ and against
            the holy covenant; _but it shall not prosper: for yet the end_, in which
            the setting up of the abomination of desolation is to prosper, _shall be at
            the time appointed. Then shall he return into his land with great riches,
            and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall act_,
            against it by spoiling the Temple, _and return into his own land_.
          </p>
          <p id="98012013">
            The _Egyptians_ of _Alexandria_ seeing _Philometor_ first educated in
            luxury by the Eunuch _Eulæus_, and now in the hands of _Antiochus_, gave
            the kingdom to _Euergetes_, the younger brother of _Philometor_. Whereupon
            _Antiochus_ pretending to restore _Philometor_, made war upon _Euergetes_;
            beat him at sea, and besieged him and his sister _Cleopatra_ in
            _Alexandria_: while the besieged Princes sent to _Rome_ to implore the
            assistance of the Senate. _Antiochus_ finding himself unable to take the
            city that year, returned into _Syria_, leaving _Philometor_ at _Memphis_ to
            govern _Egypt_ in his absence. But _Philometor_ made friendship with his
            brother that winter; and _Antiochus_, returning the next spring _An.
            Nabonass._ 580, to besiege both the brothers in _Alexandria_, was met in
            the way by the _Roman_ Ambassadors, _Popilius Læna_, _C. Decimius_, and _C.
            Hostilius_: he offered them his hand to kiss, but _Popilius_ delivering to
            him the tables wherein the message of the Senate was written, bad him read
            those first. When he had read them, he replied he would consider with his
            friends what was fit to be done; but _Popilius_ drawing a circle about him,
            bad him answer before he went out of it: _Antiochus_, astonished at this
            blunt and unusual imperiousness, made answer he would do what the _Romans_
            demanded; and then _Popilius_ gave the King his hand to kiss, and he
            returned out of _Egypt_. The same year, _An. Nabonass._ 580, his captains
            by his order spoiled and slaughtered the _Jews_, profaned the Temple, set
            up the worship of the heathen Gods in all _Judea_, and began to persecute
            and make war upon those who would not worship them: which actions are thus
            described by _Daniel_. [10] _At the time appointed he shall come_ again
            _towards the _South_, but the latter shall not be as the former. For the
            ships of _Chittim_ shall come_, with an embassy from _Rome_, _against him.
            Therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the
            holy covenant. So shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence
            with them that forsake the holy covenant._
          </p>
          <p id="98012014">
            In the same year that _Antiochus_ by the command of the _Romans_ retired
            out of _Egypt_, and set up the worship of the _Greeks_ in _Judea_; the
            _Romans_ conquered the kingdom of _Macedon_, the fundamental kingdom of the
            Empire of the _Greeks_, and reduced it into a _Roman_ Province; and thereby
            began to put an end to the reign of _Daniel_'s third Beast. This is thus
            exprest by _Daniel_. _And after him Arms_, that is the _Romans_, _shall
            stand up_. As [Hebrew: MMLK] signifies _after the King_, Dan. xi. 8; so
            [Hebrew: MMNW] may signify _after him_. _Arms_ are every where in this
            Prophecy of _Daniel_ put for the military power of a kingdom: and they
            stand up when they conquer and grow powerful. Hitherto _Daniel_ described
            the actions of the Kings of the _North_ and _South_; but upon the conquest
            of _Macedon_ by the _Romans_, he left off describing the actions of the
            _Greeks_, and began to describe those of the _Romans_ in _Greece_. They
            conquered _Macedon_, _Illyricum_ and _Epirus_, in the year of _Nabonassar_
            580. 35 years after, by the last will and testament of _Attalus_ the last
            King of _Pergamus_, they inherited that rich and flourishing kingdom, that
            is, all _Asia_ westward of mount _Taurus_; 69 years after they conquered
            the kingdom of _Syria_, and reduced it into a Province, and 34 years after
            they did the like to _Egypt_. By all these steps the _Roman_ Arms stood up
            over the _Greeks_: and after 95 years more, by making war upon the _Jews_,
            _they polluted the sanctuary of strength, and took away the daily
            sacrifice, and then placed the abomination of desolation_. For this
            abomination was placed after the days of _Christ_, _Math._ xxiv. 15. In the
            16th year of the Emperor _Adrian_, A.C. 132, they placed this abomination
            by building a Temple to _Jupiter Capitolinus_, where the Temple of God in
            _Jerusalem_ had stood. Thereupon the _Jews_ under the conduct of
            _Barchochab_ rose up in arms against the _Romans_, and in the war had 50
            cities demolished, 985 of their best towns destroyed, and 580000 men slain
            by the sword; and in the end of the war, A.C. 136, were banished _Judea_
            upon pain of death, and thenceforward the land remained desolate of its old
            inhabitants.
          </p>
          <p id="98012015">
            In the beginning of the _Jewish_ war in _Nero_'s reign, the Apostles fled
            out of _Judea_ with their flocks; some beyond _Jordan_ to _Pella_ and other
            places, some into _Egypt_, _Syria_, _Mesopotamia_, _Asia minor_, and
            elsewhere. _Peter_ and _John_ came into _Asia_, and _Peter_ went thence by
            _Corinth_ to _Rome_; but _John_ staying in _Asia_, was banished by the
            _Romans_ into _Patmos_, as the head of a party of the _Jews_, whose nation
            was in war with the _Romans_. By this dispersion of the _Christian Jews_,
            the _Christian_ religion, which was already propagated westward as far as
            _Rome_, spred fast into all the _Roman_ Empire, and suffered many
            persecutions under it till the days of _Constantine_ the great and his
            sons: all which is thus described by _Daniel_. [11] _And such as do
            wickedly against the covenant, shall he_, who places the abomination,
            _cause to dissemble_, and worship the heathen Gods; _but the people_ among
            them _who do know their God, shall be strong and act. And they that
            understand among the people, shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by
            the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by spoil many days. Now when
            they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help, viz._ in the
            reign of _Constantine_ the great; _and_ at that time by reason of their
            prosperity, _many shall_ come over to them from among the heathen, and
            _cleave to them with dissimulation. But of those of understanding there
            shall_ still _fall to try_ God's people _by them and to purge_ them from
            the dissemblers, _and to make them white even to the time of the end:
            because it is yet for a time appointed._
          </p>
          <p id="98012016">
            Hitherto the _Roman_ Empire continued entire; and under this dominion, the
            little horn of the He-Goat continued _mighty, but not by his own power_.
            But now, by the building of _Constantinople_, and endowing it with a Senate
            and other like privileges with _Rome_; and by the division of the _Roman_
            Empire into the two Empires of the _Greeks_ and _Latins_, headed by those
            two cities; a new scene of things commences, in which which [12] _a King_,
            the Empire of the _Greeks_, _doth according to his will, and_, by setting
            his own laws above the laws of God, _exalts and magnifies himself above
            every God, and speaks marvellous things against the God of Gods, and shall
            prosper till the indignation be accomplished.--Neither shall he regard the
            God of his fathers, nor the_ lawful _desire of women_ in matrimony, _nor
            any God, but shall magnify himself above all. And in his seat he shall
            honour _Mahuzzims__, that is, strong guardians, the souls of the dead;
            _even with a God whom his fathers knew not shall he honour them_, in their
            Temples, _with gold and silver, and with precious stones and valuable
            things_. All which relates to the overspreading of the _Greek_ Empire with
            Monks and Nuns, who placed holiness in abstinence from marriage; and to the
            invocation of saints and veneration of their reliques, and such like
            superstitions, which these men introduced in the fourth and fifth
            centuries. [13] _And at the time of the end the King of the_ South, or the
            Empire of the _Saracens_, _shall push at him_; _and the King of the_ North,
            or Empire of the _Turks_, _shall come against him like a whirlwind, with
            chariots and with horsemen, and with many ships_; _and be shall enter into
            the countries_ of the _Greeks_, _and shall overflow and pass over. He shall
            enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown;
            but these shall escape out of his hand, even _Edom_ and _Moab_, and the
            chief of the children_ Ammon: that is, those to whom his Caravans pay
            tribute. _He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the
            land of _Egypt_ shall not escape_; _but he shall have power over the
            treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of _Egypt_;
            and the _Lybians_ and _Ethiopians_ shall be at his steps_. All these
            nations compose the Empire of the _Turks_, and therefore this Empire is
            here to be understood by the King of the _North_. They compose also the
            body of the He-Goat; and therefore the Goat still reigns in his last horn,
            but not by his own power.
