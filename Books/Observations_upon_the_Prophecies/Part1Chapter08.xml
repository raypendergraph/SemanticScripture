          <head>Of the power of the eleventh horn of _Daniel_'s fourth Beast, to
            change times and laws.</head>
          <p id="98008002"> In the reign of the _Greek_ Emperor _Justinian_, and again in the reign of _Phocas_,
            the Bishop of _Rome_ obtained some dominion over the _Greek_ Churches, but of no long
            continuance. His standing dominion was only over the nations of the _Western Empire_,
            represented by _Daniel_'s fourth Beast. And this jurisdiction was set up by the
            following Edict of the Emperors _Gratian_ and _Valentinian.--[1] <q lang="lat">Volumus
              ut quicunque judicio
              Damasi, quod ille cum Concilio quinque vel septem habuerit Episcoporum, vel
              eorum qui Catholici sunt judicio vel Concilio condemnatus fuerit, si juste
              voluerit Ecclesiam retentare, ut qui ad sacerdotale judicium per
              contumeliam non ivisset: ut ab illustribus viris Præfectis Prætorio Galliæ
              atque Italiæ, authoritate adhibitâ, ad Episcopale judicium remittatur, sive
              à Consularibus vel Vicariis, ut ad Urbem Romam sub prosecutione perveniat.
              Aut si in longinquioribus partibus alicujus ferocitas talis emerserit,
              omnis ejus causæ edictio ad Metropolitæ in eadem Provincia Episcopi
              deduceretur examen. Vel si ipse Metropolitanus est, Romam necessariò, vel
              ad eos quos Romanus Episcopus judices dederit, sine delatione
              contendat.----Quod si vel Metropolitani Episcopi vel cujuscunque sacerdotis
              iniquitas est suspecta, aut gratia; ad Romanum Episcopum, vel ad Concilium
              quindecim finitimorum Episcoporum accersitum liceat provocare; modo ne post
              examen habitum, quod definitum fuerit, integretur_.</q> This Edict wanting the name of
            both _Valens_ and _Theodosius_ in the Title, was made in the time between their reigns,
            that is, in the end of the year 378, or the beginning of 379. It was directed to the
            _Præfecti Prætorio Italiæ &amp; Galliæ_, and therefore was general. For the _Præfectus
            Prætorio Italiæ_ governed _Italy_, _Illyricum occidentale_ and _Africa_; and the
            _Præfectus Prætorio Galliæ_ governed _Gallia_, _Spain_, and _Britain_. </p>
          <p id="98008003"> The granting of this jurisdiction to the Pope gave several Bishops occasion to write
            to him for his resolutions upon doubtful cases, whereupon he answered by decretal
            Epistles; and henceforward he gave laws to the _Western_ Churches by such Epistles.
            _Himerius_ Bishop of _Tarraco_, the head city of a province in _Spain_, writing to Pope
            _Damasus_ for his direction about certain Ecclesiastical matters, and the Letter not
            arriving at _Rome_ till after the death of _Damasus_, A.C. 384; his successor _Siricius_
            answered the same with a legislative authority, telling him of one thing: <q lang="lat">_Cum
            hoc
              fieri--missa ad Provincias à venerandæ memoriæ
              prædecessore meo Liberio generalia decreta, prohibeant_. Of another:
              _Noverint se ab omni ecclesiastico honore, quo indignè usi sunt, Apostolicæ
              Sedis auctoritate, dejectos_. Of another: _Scituri posthac omnium
              Provinciarum summi Antistites, quod si ultrò ad sacros ordines quenquam de
              talibus esse assumendum, &amp; de suo &amp; de aliorum statu, quos contra Canones
            &amp;
              interdicta nostra provexerint, congruam ab Apostolica Sede promendam esse
              sententiam_. And the Epistle he concludes thus: _Explicuimus, ut arbitror,
              frater charissime, universa quæ digesta sunt in querelam; &amp; ad singulas
              causas, de quibus ad Romanam Ecclesiam, utpote ad caput tui corporis,
              retulisti; sufficientia, quantum opinor, responsa reddidimus. Nunc
              fraternitatis tuæ animum ad servandos canones, &amp; tenenda decretalia
              constituta, magis ac magis incitamus: ad hæc quæ ad tua consulta
              rescripsimus in omnium Coepiscoporum perferri facias notionem; &amp; non solum
              corum, qui in tua sunt dioecesi constituti, sed etiam ad universos
              Carthaginenses ac Boeticos, Lusitanos atque [2] Gallicos, vel eos qui
              vicinis tibi collimitant hinc inde Provinciis, hæc quæ a nobis sunt salubri
              ordinatione disposita, sub literarum tuarum prosecutione mittantur. Et
              quanquam statuta sedis Apostolicæ vel Canonum venerabilia definita, nulli
              Sacerdotum Domini ignorare sit liberum: utilius tamen, atque pro
              antiquitate sacerdotii tui, dilectioni tuæ esse admodùm poterit gloriosum,
              si ea quæ ad te speciali nomine generaliter scripta sunt, per unanimitatis
              tuæ sollicitudinem in universorum fratrum nostrorum notitiam perferantur;
              quatenus &amp; quæ à nobis non inconsultè sed providè sub nimia cautela &amp;
            deliberatione sunt salubriter constituta, intemerata permaneant, &amp; omnibus
              in posterum excusationibus aditus, qui jam nulli apud nos patere poterit,
              obstruatur. Dat. 3 Id. Febr. Arcadio &amp; Bautone viris clarissimis
              Consulibus_, A.C. 385</q> Pope _Liberius_ in the reign of _Jovian_ or _Valentinian_ I.
            sent general Decrees to the Provinces, ordering that the _Arians_ should not be
            rebaptized: and this he did in favour of the Council of _Alexandria_, that nothing more
            should be required of them than to renounce their opinions. Pope _Damasus_ is said to
            have decreed in a _Roman_ Council, that _Tithes_ and _Tenths_ should be paid upon pain
            of an _Anathema_; and that _Glory be to the Father_, &amp;c. should be said or sung at
            the end of the _Psalms_. But the first decretal Epistle now extant is this of _Siricius_
            to _Himerius_; by which the Pope made _Himerius_ his Vicar over all _Spain_ for
            promulging his Decrees, and seeing them observed. The Bishop of _Sevill_ was also the
            Pope's Vicar sometimes; for _Simplicius_ wrote thus to _Zeno_ Bishop of that place: <q lang="lat"> _Talibus idcirco
              gloriantes indiciis, congruum duximus vicariâ Sedis nostræ te auctoritate
              fulciri: cujus vigore munitus, Apostolicæ institutionis Decreta, vel
              sanctorum terminos Patrum, nullatenus transcendi permittas_.</q> And Pope _Hormisda_
            [3] made the Bishop of _Sevill_ his Vicar over _Boetica_ and _Lusitania_, and the Bishop
            of _Tarraco_ his Vicar over all the rest of _Spain_, as appears by his Epistles to them. </p>
          <p id="98008004">
            Pope _Innocent_ the first, in his decretal Epistle to _Victricius_ Bishop of _Rouen_ in
            _France_, A.C. 404, in pursuance of the Edict of _Gratian_, made this Decree:</p>
          <q lang="lat">
            <p id="98008005">_Si quæ autem causæ vel contentiones inter Clericos tam
              superioris ordinis quam etiam inferioris fuerint exortæ; ut secundum
              Synodum Nicenam congregatis ejusdem Provinciæ Episcopis jurgium terminetur:
              nec alicui liceat, [4] Romanæ Ecclesiæ, cujus in omnibus causis debet
              reverentia custodiri, relictis his sacerdotibus, qui in eadem Provincia Dei
              Ecclesiam nutu Divino gubernant, ad alias convolare Provincias. Quod siquis
              fortè præsumpserit; &amp; ab officio Clericatûs summotus, &amp; injuriarum reus
              judicetur. Si autem majores causæ in medium fuerint devolutæ, ad Sedem
              Apostolicam sicut Synodus statuit, &amp; beata consuetudo exigit, post judicium
              Episcopale referantur_.</p>
          </q>
          <p id="98008006">By these Letters it seems to me that _Gallia_ was now subject to
            the Pope, and had been so for some time, and that the Bishop of _Rouen_ was then his
            Vicar or
            one of them: for the Pope directs him to refer the greater causes to the See of _Rome_,
            according to custom. But the Bishop of _Arles_ soon after became the Pope's Vicar over
            all
            _Gallia_: for Pope _Zosimus_, A.C. 417, ordaining that none should have access to him
            without
            the credentials of his Vicars, conferred upon _Patroclus_ the Bishop of _Arles_ this
            authority
            over all _Gallia_, by the following Decree.</p>
          <q lang="lat">
            <head>_Zosimus universis Episcopis per Gallias &amp; septem
              Provincias constitutis_.</head>
            <p id="98008007">_Placuit Apostolicæ Sedi, ut siquis ex qualibet Galliarum
              parte sub quolibet ecclesiastico gradu ad nos Romæ venire contendit, vel aliò terrarum
              ire
              disponit, non aliter proficiscatur nisi Metropolitani Episcopi Formatas acceperit,
              quibus
              sacerdotium suum vel locum ecclesiasticum quem habet, scriptorum ejus adstipulatione
              perdoceat:
              quod ex gratia statuimus quia plures episcopi sive presbyteri sive ecclesiastici
              simulantes,
              quia
              nullum documentum Formatarum extat per quod valeant confutari, in nomen venerationis
              irrepunt,
              &amp; indebitam reverentiam promerentur. Quisquis igitur, fratres charissimi,

              misisse
              manifestum est, ut cunctis regionibus innoteGrpcat id quod statuimus omnimodis esse
              servandum.
              Siquis autem hæc salubriter constituta temerare tentaverit sponte suâ, se a nostra
              noverit
              communione discretum. Hoc autem privilegium Formatarum sancto Patroclo fratri &amp;
              coepiscopo
              nostro, meritorum ejus speciali contemplatione, concessimus_. And that the Bishop of
              _Arles_
              was
              sometimes the Pope's Vicar over all _France_, is affirmed also by all the Bishops of
              the
              Diocess
              of _Arles_ in their Letter to Pope _Leo_ I. _Cui id etiam honoris dignitatisque
              collatum
              est_,
              say
              they, _ut non tantum has Provincias potestate propriâ gubernaret; verum etiam omnes
              Gallias
              sibi
              Apostolicæ Sedis vice mandatas, sub omni ecclesiastica regula contineret_. And Pope
              _Pelagius_ I.
              A.C. 556, in his Epistle to _Sapaudus_ Bishop of _Arles_: _Majorum nostrorum, operante
              Dei
              misericordiâ, cupientes inhærere vestigiis &amp; eorum actus divino examine in omnibus
              imitari:
              Charitati tuæ per universam Galliam, sanctæ Sedis Apostolicæ, cui divinâ gratiâ
              præsidemus,

              injungimus_.</p>
          </q>
          <p id="98008008"> By the influence of the same imperial Edict, not only _Spain_ and _Gallia_, but also
            _Illyricum_ became subject to the Pope. _Damasus_ made _Ascholius_, or _Acholius_,
            Bishop of _Thessalonica_ the Metropolis of _Oriental Illyricum_, his Vicar for hearing
            of causes; and in the year 382, _Acholius_ being summoned by Pope _Damasus_, came to a
            Council at _Rome_. Pope _Siricius_ the successor of _Damasus_, decreed that no Bishop
            should be ordained in _Illyricum_ without the consent of _Anysius_ the successor of
            _Acholius_. And the following Popes gave _Rufus_ the successor of _Anysius_, a power of
            calling Provincial Councils: for in the Collections of _Holstenius_ there is an account
            of a Council of _Rome_ convened under Pope _Boniface_ II. in which were produced Letters
            of _Damasus_, _Syricius_, _Innocent_ I. _Boniface_ I. and _Cælestine_ Bishops of _Rome_,
            to _Ascholius_, _Anysius_ and _Rufus_, Bishops of _Thessalonica_: in which Letters they
            commend to them the hearing of causes in _Illyricum_, granted by the Lord and the holy
            Canons to the Apostolic See thro'out that Province. And Pope _Siricius_ saith in his
            Epistle to _Anysius_: <q lang="lat">_Etiam
              dudum, frater charissime, per Candidianum Episcopum, qui nos præcessit ad
              Dominum, hujusmodi literas dederamus, ut nulla licentia esset, sine
              consensu tuo in Illyrico Episcopos ordinare præsumere, quæ utrum ad te
              pervenerint scire non potui. Multa enim gesta sunt per contentionem ab
              Episcopis in ordinationibus faciendis, quod tua melius caritas novit_. And
              a little after: _Ad omnem enim hujusmodi audaciam comprimendam vigilare
              debet instantia tua, Spiritu in te Sancto fervente: ut vel ipse, si potes,
              vel quos judicaveris Episcopos idoneos, cum literis dirigas, dato consensu
              qui possit, in ejus locum qui defunctus vel depositus fuerit, Catholicum
              Episcopum vitâ &amp; moribus probatum, secundum Nicænæ Synodi statuta vel
              Ecclesiæ Romanæ, Clericum de Clero meritum ordinare_. And Pope _Innocent_
              I. saith in his Epistle to _Anysius_: _Cui_ [Anysio] _etiam anteriores
              tanti ac tales viri prædecessores mei Episcopi, id est, sanctæ memoriæ
              Damasus, Siricius, atque supra memoratus vir ita detulerunt; ut omnia quæ
              in omnibus illis partibus gererentur, Sanctitati tuæ, quæ plena justitiæ
              est, traderent cognoscenda_. And in his Epistle to _Rufus_ the successor of
              _Anysius_: _Ita longis intervallis disterminatis à me ecclesiis discat
              consulendum; ut prudentiæ gravitatique tuæ committendam curam causasque,
              siquæ exoriantur, per Achaiæ, Thessaliæ, Epiri veteris, Epiri novæ, &amp;
              Cretæ, Daciæ mediterraneæ, Daciæ ripensis, Moesiæ, Dardaniæ, &amp; Prævali
              ecclesias, Christo Domino annuente, censeam. Verè enim ejus sacratissimis
              monitis lectissimæ sinceritatis tuæ providentiæ &amp; virtuti hanc injungimus
            sollicitudinem: non primitùs hæc statuentes, sed Præcessores nostros
              Apostolicos imitati, qui beatissimis Acholio &amp; Anysio injungi pro meritis
              ista voluerunt_. And _Boniface_ I. in his decretal Epistle to _Rufus_ and
              the rest of the Bishops in _Illyricum_: _Nullus, ut frequenter dixi,
              alicujus ordinationem citra ejus_ [Episcopi Thessalonicensis] _conscientiam
              celebrare præsumat: cui, ut supra dictum est, vice nostrâ cuncta
              committimus_. And Pope _Cælestine_, in his decretal Epistle to the Bishops
              thro'out _Illyricum_, saith: _Vicem nostram per vestram Provinciam
              noveritis_ [Rufo] _esse commissam, ita ut ad eum, fratres carissimi,
              quicquid de causis agitur, referatur. Sine ejus consilio nullus ordinetur.
              Nullus usurpet, eodem inconscio, commissam illi Provinciam; colligere nisi
              cum ejus voluntate Episcopus non præsumat_. And in the cause of
              _Perigenes_, in the title of his Epistle, he thus enumerates the Provinces
              under this Bishop: _Rufo &amp; cæteris Episcopis per Macedoniam, Achaiam,
              Thessaliam, Epirum veterem, Epirum novam, Prævalin, &amp; Daciam constitutis_.
              And Pope _Xistus_ in a decretal Epistle to the same Bishops: _Illyricanæ
              omnes Ecclesiæ, ut à decessoribus nostris recepimus, &amp; nos quoque fecimus,
              ad curam nunc pertinent Thessalonicensis Antistitis, ut suâ sollicitudine,
              siquæ inter fratres nascantur, ut assolent, actiones distinguat atque
              definiat; &amp; ad eum, quicquid à singulis sacerdotibus agitur, referatur. Sit
            Concilium, quotiens causæ fuerint, quotiens ille pro necessitatum
              emergentium ratione decreverit_.</q> And Pope _Leo_ I. in his decretal Epistle to
            _Anastasius_ Bishop of _Thessalonica_: <q lang="lat">_Singulis autem Metropolitanis
              sicut potestas ista committitur, ut in suis Provinciis jus habeant
              ordinandi; ita eos Metropolitanos à te volumus ordinari; maturo tamen &amp;
              decocto judicio_.</q> _Occidental Illyricum_ comprehended _Pannonia prima_ and
            _secunda_, _Savia_, _Dalmatia_, _Noricum mediterraneum_, and _Noricum ripense_; and its
            Metropolis was _Sirmium_, till _Attila_ destroyed this city. Afterwards _Laureacum_
            became the Metropolis of _Noricum_ and both _Pannonias_, and _Salona_ the Metropolis of
            _Dalmatia_. Now [5] the Bishops of _Laureacum_ and _Salona_ received the _Pallium_ from
            the Pope: and _Zosimus_, in his decretal Epistle to _Hesychius_ Bishop of _Salona_,
            directed him to denounce the Apostolic decrees as well to the Bishops of his own, as to
            those of the neighbouring Provinces. The subjection of these Provinces to the See of
            _Rome_ seems to have begun in _Anemius_, who was ordained Bishop of _Sirmium_ by
            _Ambrose_ Bishop of _Millain_, and who in the Council of _Aquileia_ under Pope
            _Damasus_, A.C. 381, declared his sentence in these words: _Caput Illyrici non nisi
            civitas Sirmiensis: Ego igitur illius civitatis Episcopus sum. Eum qui non confitetur
            filium Dei æternum, &amp; coeternum patri, qui est sempiternus, anathema dico_. The next
            year _Anemius_ and _Ambrose_, with _Valerian_ Bishop of _Aquileia_, _Acholias_ Bishop of
            _Thessalonica,_ and many others, went to the Council of _Rome_, which met for overruling
            the _Greek_ Church by majority of votes, and exalting the authority of the Apostolic
            See, as was attempted before in the Council of _Sardica_. </p>
          <p id="98008009"> _Aquileia_ was the second city of the _Western Empire_, and by some called the second
            _Rome_. It was the Metropolis of _Istria_, _Forum Julium_, and _Venetia_; and its
            subjection to the See of _Rome_ is manifest by the decretal Epistle of _Leo_ I. directed
            to _Nicetas_ Bishop of this city; for the Pope begins his Epistle thus:<q lang="lat">_Regressus
            ad nos filius meus Adeodatus
              Diaconus Sedis nostræ, dilectionem tuam poposcisse memorat, ut de his à
              nobis authoritatem Apostolicæ Sedis acciperes, quæ quidem magnam
              difficultatem dijudicationis videntur afferre_. Then he sets down an answer
              to the questions proposed by _Nicetas_, and concludes thus: _Hanc autem
              Epistolam nostram, quam ad consultationem tuæ fraternitatis emisimus, ad

              omnium observantia, data profit authoritas. Data 1-2 Kal. Apr. Majorano
              Aug. Cos._ A.C. 458. _Gregory_ the great A.C. 591</q>, [6] cited _Severus_ Bishop of
            _Aquileia_ to appear before him in judgment in a Council at _Rome_. </p>
          <p id="98008010"> The Bishops of _Aquileia_ and _Millain_ created one another, and therefore were of
            equal authority, and alike subject to the See of _Rome_. Pope _Pelagius_ about the year
            557, testified this in the following words: <q lang="lat">[7]
              _Mos antiquus fuit_, saith he, _ut quia pro longinquitate vel difficultate
              itineris, ab Apostolico illis onerosum fuerit ordinari, ipsi se invicem
              Mediolanensis &amp; Aquileiensis ordinare Episcopos debuissent_.</q> These words imply
            that the ordination of these two Bishops belonged to the See of _Rome_. When
            _Laurentius_ Bishop of _Millain_ had excommunicated _Magnus_, one of his Presbyters, and
            was dead, [8] _Gregory_ the great absolved _Magnus_, and sent the _Pallium_ to the new
            elected Bishop _Constantius_; whom the next year [9] he reprehended of partiality in
            judging _Fortunatus_, and commanded him to send _Fortunatus_ to _Rome_ to be judged
            there: four years after [10] he appointed the Bishops of _Millain_ and _Ravenna_ to hear
            the cause of one _Maximus_; and two years after, viz. A.C. 601, when _Constantius_ was
            dead, and the people of _Millain_ had elected _Deusdedit_ his successor, and the
            _Lombards_ had elected another, [11] _Gregory_ wrote to the Notary, Clergy, and People
            of _Millain_, that by the authority of his Letters _Deusdedit_ should be ordained, and
            that he whom the _Lombards_ had ordained was an unworthy successor of _Ambrose_: whence
            I gather, that the Church of _Millain_ had continued in this state of subordination to
            the See of _Rome_ ever since the days of _Ambrose_; for _Ambrose_ himself acknowledged
            the authority of that See. _Ecclesia Romana_, [12] saith he, <q lang="lat">_hanc
            consuetudinem non habet,
              cujus
              typum in
              omnibus sequimur, &amp; formam_.</q> And a little after: <q lang="lat">_In omnibus
            cupio sequi
              Ecclesiam Romanam_.</q> And in his Commentary upon 1 _Tim_. iii. <q lang="lat">_Cum
            totus
              mundus Dei sit, tamen domus ejus Ecclesia dicitur, cujus hodie rector est
              Damasus_.</q> In his Oration on the death of his brother _Satyrus_, he relates how his
            brother coming to a certain city of _Sardinia_, <q lang="lat">_advocavit
              Episcopum loci, percontatusque est ex eo utrum cum Episcopis Catholicis hoc
              est cum Romana Ecclesia conveniret?_</q> And in conjunction with the Synod of
            _Aquileia_ A.C. 381, in a synodical Epistle to the Emperor _Gratian_, he saith: <q lang="lat">_Totius
              orbis Romani caput Romanam Ecclesiam, atque illam
              sacrosanctam Apostolorum fidem, ne turbari sineret, obsecranda fuit
              clementia vestra; inde enim in omnes venerandæ communionis jura dimanant_.</q> The
            Churches therefore of _Aquileia_ and _Millain_ were subject to the See of _Rome_ from
            the days of the Emperor _Gratian_. _Auxentius_ the predecessor of _Ambrose_ was not
            subject to the see of _Rome_, and consequently the subjection of the Church of _Millain_
            began in _Ambrose_. This Diocese of _Millain_ contained _Liguria_ with _Insubria_, the
            _Alpes Cottiæ_ and _Rhætia_; and was divided from the Diocese of _Aquileia_ by the river
            _Addua_. In the year 844, the Bishop of _Millain_ broke off from the See of _Rome_, and
            continued in this separation about 200 years, as is thus related by [13] _Sigonius_: <q lang="lat">_Eodem anno Angilbertus
              Mediolanensis
              Archiepiscopus ab Ecclesia Romana parum comperta de causa descivit,
              tantumque exemplo in posterum valuit, ut non nisi post ducentos annos
              Ecclesia Mediolanensis ad Romanæ obedientiam auctoritatemque redierit_.</q>
          </p>
          <p id="98008011"> The Bishop of _Ravenna_, the Metropolis of _Flaminia_ and _Æmilia_, was also subject
            to the Pope: for _Zosimus_, A.C. 417, excommunicated some of the Presbyters of that
            Church, and wrote a commonitory Epistle about them to the Clergy of that Church as a
            branch of the _Roman_ Church: _In sua_, saith he, _hoc est, in Ecclesia nostra Romana_.
            When those of _Ravenna_, having elected a new Bishop, gave notice thereof to Pope
            _Sixtus_, the Pope set him aside, and [14] ordained _Peter Chrysologus_ in his room.
            _Chrysologus_ in his Epistle to _Eutyches_, extant in the Acts of the Council of
            _Chalcedon_, wrote thus: <q lang="lat" inline="true">_Nos
              pro
              studio pacis &amp; fidei, extra
              consensum Romanæ civitatis Episcopi, causas fidei audire non possumus_.</q> Pope _Leo_
            I. being consulted by _Leo_ Bishop of _Ravenna_ about some questions, answered him by a
            decretal Epistle A.C. 451. And Pope _Gregory_ the great, [15] reprehending _John_ Bishop
            of _Ravenna_ about the use of the _Pallium_, tells him of a Precept of one of his
            Predecessors, Pope _John_, commanding that all the Privileges formerly granted to the
            Bishop and Church of _Ravenna_ should be kept: to this _John_ returned a submissive
            answer; and after his death Pope _Gregory_ ordered a visitation of the Church of
            _Ravenna_, confirmed the privileges heretofore granted them, and sent his _Pallium_, as
            of antient custom, to their new Bishop _Marinian_. Yet this Church revolted sometimes
            from the Church of _Rome_, but returned again to its obedience. </p>
          <p id="98008012"> The rest of _Italy_, with the Islands adjacent, containing the _suburbicarian_
            regions, or ten Provinces under the temporal Vicar of _Rome, viz._ 1_Campania_,
            2_Tuscia_ and _Umbria_, 3_Picenum suburbicarium_, 4_Sicily_, 5_Apulia_ and _Calabria_,
            6_Brutii_ and _Lucania_, 7_Samnium_, 8_Sardinia_, 9_Corsica_, and 10_Valeria_,
            constituted the proper Province of the Bishop of _Rome_. For the Council of _Nice_ in
            their fifth Canon ordained that Councils should be held every spring and autumn in every
            Province; and according to this Canon, the Bishops of this Province met at _Rome_ every
            half year. In this sense Pope _Leo_ I. applied this Canon to _Rome_, in a decretal
            Epistle to the Bishops of _Sicily_, written _Alippio &amp; Ardabure Coss_. A.C. 447. <q lang="lat">_Quia saluberrime_</q>, saith he, <q lang="lat">_à sanctis
              patribus constitutum est, binos in annis singulis Episcoporum debere esse
              conventus, terni semper ex vobis ad diem tertium Kalendarum Octobrium Romam
              æterno concilio sociandi occurrant. Et indissimulanter à vobis hæc
              consuetudo servetur, quoniam adjuvante Dei gratiâ, faciliùs poterit
              provideri, ut in Ecclesiis Christi nulla scandala, nulli nascantur errores;
              cum coram Apostolo Petro semper in communione tractatum fuerit, ut omnia
              Canonum Decreta apud omnes Domini sacerdotes inviolata permaneant_.</q> The Province
            of _Rome_ therefore comprehended _Sicily_, with so much of _Italy_ and the neighbouring
            Islands as sent Bishops to the annual Councils of _Rome_; but extended not into the
            Provinces of _Ravenna_, _Aquileia_, _Millain_, _Arles_, &amp;c. those Provinces having
            Councils of their own. The Bishops in every Province of the _Roman_ Empire were convened
            in Council by the Metropolitan or Bishop of the head city of the Province, and this
            Bishop presided in that Council: but the Bishop of _Rome_ did not only preside in his
            own Council of the Bishops of the _suburbicarian_ regions, but also gave Orders to the
            Metropolitans of all the other Provinces in the _Western Empire_, as their universal
            governor; as may be further perceived by the following instances. </p>
          <p id="98008013"> Pope _Zosimus_ A.C. 417, cited _Proculus_ Bishop of _Marseilles_ to appear before a
            Council at _Rome_ for illegitimate Ordinations; and condemned him, as he mentions in
            several of his Epistles. Pope _Boniface_ I. A.C. 419, upon a complaint of the Clergy of
            _Valentia_ against _Maximus_ a Bishop, summoned the Bishops of all _Gallia_ and the
            seven Provinces to convene in a Council against him; and saith in his Epistle, that his
            Predecessors had done the like. Pope _Leo_ I. called a general Council of all the
            Provinces of _Spain_ to meet in _Gallæcia_ against the _Manichees_ and
            _Priscillianists_, as he says in his decretal Epistle to _Turribius_ a _Spanish_ Bishop.
            And in one of his decretal Epistles to _Nicetas_ Bishop of _Aquileia_, he commands him
            to call a Council of the Bishops of that Province against the _Pelagians_, which might
            ratify all the Synodal Decrees which had been already ratified by the See of _Rome_
            against this heresy. And in his decretal Epistle to _Anastasius_ Bishop of
            _Thessalonica_, he ordained that Bishop should hold two Provincial Councils every year,
            and refer the harder causes to the See of _Rome_: and if upon any extraordinary occasion
            it should be necessary to call a Council, he should not be troublesom to the Bishops
            under him, but content himself with two Bishops out of every Province, and not detain
            them above fifteen days. In the same Epistle he describes the form of Church-Government
            then set up, to consist in a subordination of all the Churches to the See of _Rome_: <q lang="lat">_De
              qua forma_, saith he, _Episcoporum quoque est orta distinctio, &amp; magna
              dispositione provisum est ne omnes sibi omnia vindicarent, sed essent in
              singulis Provinciis singuli quorum inter fratres haberetur prima sententia,
              &amp; rursus quidam in majoribus urbibus constituti sollicitudinem sumerent
              ampliorem, per quos ad unam Petri Sedem universalis Ecclesiæ cura
              conflueret, &amp; nihil usque à suo capite dissideret. Qui ergo scit se
              quibusdam esse præpositum, non moleste ferat aliquem sibi esse præpositum;
              sed obedientiam quam exigit etiam ipse dependat; et sicut non vult gravis
              oneris sarcinam ferre, ita non audeat aliis importabile pondus imponere_.</q> These
            words sufficiently shew the monarchical form of government then set up in the Churches
            of the _Western Empire_ under the Bishop of _Rome_, by means of the imperial Decree of
            _Gratian_, and the appeals and decretal Epistles grounded thereupon. </p>
          <p id="98008014"> The same Pope _Leo_, having in a
            Council at _Rome_ passed sentence upon _Hilary_ Bishop of _Arles_, for what he had done
            by a
            Provincial Council in _Gallia_, took occasion from thence to procure the following Edict
            from
            the _Western_ Emperor _Valentinian_ III. for the more absolute establishing the
            authority of
            his
            See over all the Churches of the _Western Empire_.</p>

            the Emperor _Valentinian_ enjoined an absolute obedience to the will of the Bishop of
            _Rome_
            thro'out all the Churches of his Empire; and declares, that for the Bishops to attempt
            any
            thing
            without the Pope's authority is contrary to antient custom, and that the Bishops

              And _Ceratius_, _Salonius_ and _Veranus_, three Bishops of _Gallia_, say,

              And _Leo_ himself, in [16] his Epistle to the metropolitan Bishops thro'out

            While this Ecclesiastical Dominion was rising up, the northern barbarous
            nations invaded the _Western Empire_, and founded several kingdoms therein,
            of different religions from the Church of _Rome_. But these kingdoms by
            degrees embraced the _Roman_ faith, and at the same time submitted to the
            Pope's authority. The _Franks_ in _Gaul_ submitted in the end of the fifth
            Century, the _Goths_ in _Spain_ in the end of the sixth; and the _Lombards_
            in _Italy_ were conquered by _Charles_ the great A.C. 774. Between the
            years 775 and 794, the same _Charles_ extended the Pope's authority over
            all _Germany_ and _Hungary_ as far as the river _Theysse_ and the _Baltic_
            sea; he then set him above all human judicature, and at the same time
            assisted him in subduing the City and Duchy of _Rome_. By the conversion of
            the ten kingdoms to the _Roman_ religion, the Pope only enlarged his
            spiritual dominion, but did not yet rise up as a horn of the Beast. It was
            his temporal dominion which made him one of the horns: and this dominion he
            acquired in the latter half of the eighth century, by subduing three of the
            former horns as above. And now being arrived at a temporal dominion, and a
            power above all human judicature, he reigned [17] _with a look more stout
            than his fellows_, and [18] _times and laws were_ henceforward _given into
            his hands, for a time times and half a time_, or three times and an half;
            that is, for 1260 solar years, reckoning a time for a Calendar year of 360
            days, and a day for a solar year. After which [19] _the judgment is to sit,
            and they shall take away his dominion_, not at once, but by degrees, _to
            consume, and to destroy it unto the end. [20] And the kingdom and dominion,
            and greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall_, by degrees, _be
            given unto the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an
            everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him_.
