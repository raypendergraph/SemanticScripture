            that _Rome_ was besieged and taken by the _Goths_, became broken into the following ten
            kingdoms. <list rend="simple">
              <item>The kingdom of the _Vandals_ and _Alans_ in _Spain_ and _Africa_.</item>

            Seven of these kingdoms are thus mentioned by _Sigonius_. 1_Honorio
            regnante_, _in Pannoniam_ 2_Hunni_, _in Hispaniam_ 3_Vandali_, 4_Alani_,
            5_Suevi_ &amp; 6_Gothi_, _in Galliam_ 4_Alani_ 7_Burgundiones_ &amp; 6_Gothi_,
            _certis sedibus permissis, accepti_. Add the _Franks_, _Britains_, and
            _Lombards_, and you have the ten: for these arose about the same time with
            the seven. But let us view them severally.
          </p>
          <list rend="bulleted">
            <item>The Kings of the _Vandals_ were, A.C. 407 _Godegesilus_, 407 _Gunderic_,
              426 _Geiseric_, 477 _Hunneric_, 484 _Gundemund_, 496 _Thrasamund_, 513
              _Geiseric_, 530 _Gelimer_. _Godegesilus_ led them into _Gallia_ A.C. 406,
              _Gunderic_ into _Spain_ A.C. 409, _Geiseric_ into _Africa_ A.C. 427; and
              _Gelimer_ was conquered by _Belisarius_ A.C. 533. Their kingdom lasted in
              _Gallia_, _Spain_ and _Africa_ together 126 years; and in _Africa_ they
              were very potent. The _Alans_ had only two Kings of their own in _Spain_,
              _Resplendial_, and _Ataces_, _Utacus_ or _Othacar_. Under _Resplendial_
              they went into _France_ A.C. 407, and into _Spain_ A.C. 409. _Ataces_ was
              slain with almost all his army by _Vallia_ King of the _Visigoths_ A.C.
              419. And then the remainder of these _Alans_ subjected themselves to
              _Gunderic_ King of the _Vandals_ in _Boetica_, and went afterwards with
              them into _Africa_, as I learn out of _Procopius_. Whence the Kings of the
              _Vandals_ styled themselves Kings of the _Vandals_ and _Alans_; as may be
              seen in the Edict of _Hunneric_ recited by _Victor_ in his _Vandalic_
              persecution. In conjunction with the _Chatti_, these _Alans_ gave the name
              of _Cathalaunia_, or _Catth-Alania_, to the Province which is still so
              called. These _Alans_ had also _Gepides_ among them; and therefore the
              _Gepides_ came into _Pannonia_ before the _Alans_ left it. There they
              became subject to the _Hunns_ till the death of _Attila_ A.C. 454, and at
              length were conquered by the _Ostrogoths_.
            </item>
            <item>The Kings of the _Suevians_ were, A.C. 407 _Ermeric_, 458 _Rechila_, 448
              _Rechiarius_, 458 _Maldra_, 460 _Frumarius_, 463 _Regismund_. And after
              some other Kings who are unknown, reigned A.C. 558 _Theudomir_, 568 _Miro_,
              582 _Euboricus_, and 583 _Andeca_. This kingdom, after it had been once
              seated in _Spain_, remained always in _Gallæcia_ and _Lusitania_. _Ermeric_
              after the fall of the _Alan_ kingdom, enlarged it into all _Gallæcia_,
              forcing the _Vandals_ to retire into _Boetica_ and the _Carthaginian_
              Province. This kingdom lasted 177 years according to _Isidorus_, and then
              was subdued by _Leovigildus_ King of the _Visigoths_, and made a Province
              of his kingdom A.C. 585.
            </item>
            <item>The Kings of the _Visigoths_ were, A.C. 400 _Alaric_, 410 _Athaulphus_,
              415 _Sergeric_ and _Vallia_, 419 _Theoderic_, 451 _Thorismund_, 452
              _Theoderic_, 465 _Euric_, 482 _Alaric_, 505 _Gensalaric_, 526 _Amalaric_,
              531 _Theudius_, 548 _Theudisclus_, &amp;c. I date this kingdom from the time
              that _Alaric_ left _Thrace_ and _Greece_ to invade the _Western Empire_. In
              the end of the reign of _Athaulphus_ the _Goths_ were humbled by the
              _Romans_, and attempted to pass out of _France_ into _Spain_. _Sergeric_
              reigned but a few days. In the beginning of _Vallia_'s reign they assaulted
              the _Romans_ afresh, but were again repulsed, and then made peace on this
              condition, that they should on the behalf of the Empire invade the
              _Barbarian_ kingdoms in _Spain_: and this they did, together with the
              _Romans_, in the years 417 and 418, overthrowing the _Alans_ and part of
              the _Vandals_. Then they received _Aquitain_ of the Emperor by a full
              donation, leaving their conquests in _Spain_ to the Emperor: and thereby
              the seats of the conquered _Alans_ came into the hands of the _Romans_. In
              the year 455, _Theoderic_, assisted by the _Burgundians_, invaded _Spain_,
              which was then almost all subject to the _Suevians_, and took a part of it
              from them. A.C. 506, the _Goths_ were driven out of _Gallia_ by the
              _Franks_. A.C. 585, they conquered the _Suevian_ kingdom, and became Lords
              of all _Spain_. A.C. 713, the _Saracens_ invaded them, but in time they
              recovered their dominions, and have reigned in _Spain_ ever since.
            </item>
            <item>The Kings of the _Alans_ in _Gallia_ were _Goar_, _Sambida_, _Eocharic_,
              _Sangibanus_, _Beurgus_, &amp;c. Under _Goar_ they invaded _Gallia_ A.C. 407,
              and had seats given them near the _Rhine_, A.C. 412. Under _Sambida_, whom
              _Bucher_ makes the successor, if not the son of _Goar_, they had the
              territories of _Valence_ given them by _Ætius_ the Emperor's General, A.C.
              440. Under _Eocharic_ they conquered a region of the rebelling _Galli
              Arborici_, given them also by _Ætius_. This region was from them named
              _Alenconium, quasi Alanorum conventus_. Under _Sangibanus_ they were
              invaded, and their regal city _Orleans_ was besieged by _Attila_ King of
              the _Hunns_, with a vast army of 500000 men. _Ætius_ and the _Barbarian_
              Kings of _Gallia_ came to raise the siege, and beat the _Hunns_ in a very
              memorable battle, A.C. 451, _in campis Catalaunicis_, so called from these
              _Alans_ mixt with the _Chatti_. The region is now called _Campania_ or
              _Champagne_. In that battle were slain on both sides 162000 men. A year or
              two after, _Attila_ returned with an immense army to conquer this kingdom,
              but was again beaten by them and the _Visigoths_ together in a battle of
              three days continuance, with a slaughter almost as great as the former.
              Under _Beurgus_, or _Biorgor_, they infested _Gallia_ round about, till the
              reign of _Maximus_ the Emperor; and then they passed the _Alps_ in winter,
              and came into _Liguria_, but were there beaten, and _Beurgus_ slain, by
              _Ricimer_ commander of the Emperor's forces, A.C. 464. Afterwards they were
              again beaten, by the joint force of _Odoacer_ King of _Italy_ and
              _Childeric_ King of the _Franks_, about the year 480, and again by
              _Theudobert_ King of the _Austrian Franks_ about the year 511.
            </item>
            <item>
              The Kings of the _Burgundians_ were, A.C. 407 _Gundicar_, 436 _Gundioc_,
              467 _Bilimer_, 473 _Gundobaldus_ with his brothers, 510 _Sigismund_, 517
              _Godomarus_. Under _Gundicar_ they invaded _Gallia_ A.C. 407, and had seats
              given them by the Emperor near the _Rhine_ in _Gallia Belgica_, A.C. 412.
              They had _Saxons_ among them, and were now so potent, that _Orosius_ A.C.
              417 wrote of them: '_Burgundionum esse prævalidam manum, Galliæ hodieque
              testes sunt, in quibus præsumpta possessione consistunt_. About the year
              435 they received great overthrows by _Ætius_, and soon after by the
              _Hunns_: but five years after had _Savoy_ granted them to be shared with
              the inhabitants; and from that time became again a potent kingdom, being
              bounded by the river _Rhodanus_, but afterwards extending much further into
              the heart of _Gallia_. _Gundobald_ conquered the regions about the rivers
              _Araris_ and _Rhodanus_, with the territories of _Marseilles_; and invading
              _Italy_ in the time of the Emperor _Glycerius_, conquered all his brethren.
              _Godomarus_ made _Orleans_ his royal seat: whence the kingdom was called
              _Regnum Aurelianorum_. He was conquered by _Clotharius_ and _Childebert_,
              Kings of the _Franks_, A.C. 526. From thenceforward this kingdom was
              sometimes united to the kingdom of the _Franks_, and sometimes divided from
              it, till the reign of _Charles_ the great, who made his son _Carolottus_
              King of _Burgundy_. From that time, for about 300 years together, it
              enjoyed its proper Kings; and was then broken into the Dukedom of
              _Burgundy_, County of _Burgundy_, and County of _Savoy_; and afterwards
              those were broken into other lesser Counties.

              </q> Now for _Genobaldus_, _Marcomer_ and _Suno_, they
              were captains of the _Transrhenane Franks_ in the reign of _Theodosius_, and concern
              us not. We are to begin with _Theudomir_ the first King of the rebelling _Salii_,
              called _Didio_ by _Ivo Carnotensis_, and _Thiedo_ and _Theudemerus_ by _Rhenanus_. His
              face is extant in a coin of gold found with this inscription, THEUDEMIR REX, published
              by _Petavius_, and still or lately extant, as _Windeline_ testifies: which shews that
              he was a King, and that in _Gallia_; seeing that rude _Germany_ understood not then
              the coining of money, nor used either _Latin_ words or letters. He was the son of
              _Ricimer_, or _Richomer_, the favourite of the Emperor _Theodosius_; and so being a
              _Roman Frank_, and of the _Salian_ royal blood, they therefore upon the rebellion made
              him King. The whole time of his reign you have stated in _Excerptis Gregorii
              Turonensis è Fredigario_, _cap._ 5, 6, 7, 8. where the making him King, the tyranny of
              _Jovinus_, the slaughter of the associates of _Jovinus_, the second taking of _Triers_
              by the _Franks_, and their war with _Castinus_, in which this King was slain, are as a
              series of successive things thus set down in order. <q lang="lat"> _Extinctis Ducibus
              in
                Francis, denuo Reges creantur ex eadem stirpe qua prius fuerant. Eodem tempore
              Jovinus ornatus regios assumpsit. Constantinus fugam versus Italiam

                to speak of _Theudomir_, he adds: _Franci electum à se regem, sicut prius
                fuerat, crinitum inquirentes diligenter ex genere Priami, Frigi &amp;

                hoc prælio quod supra memini, à Romanis interfectus est_; that is, in the
                battle with _Castinus_'s army. Of his death _Gregory Turonensis_ makes this
                further mention: _In consularibus legimus Theodemerem regem Francorum
                filium Ricimeris quondam, &amp; Ascilam matrem ejus, gladio interfectos_.</q><p id="98006009">
                Upon this victory of the _Romans_, the _Franks_ and rebelling _Gauls_, who in the
              time of
                _Theudomir_ were at war with one another, united to strengthen themselves, as
              _Ordericus
                Vitalis_[1] thus mentions. _Cum Galli prius contra Romanos rebellâssent, Franci iis
              sociati
                sunt,
                &amp; pariter juncti, Ferramundum Sunonis ducis filium, sibi regem præfecerunt_.
              _Prosper_
                sets
                down the time; _Anno 25 Honorii, Pharamundus regnat in Francia_. This, _Bucher_ well
              observes,
                refers to the end of the year 416, or the beginning of the next year, dating the
              years of
                _Honorius_ from the death of _Valentinian_; and argues well, that at this time
              _Pharamond_
                was not
                only King by the constitution of the _Franks_, but crowned also by the consent of
              _Honorius_, and
                had a part of _Gallia_ assigned him by covenant. And this might be the cause that
              _Roman_
                writers
                reckoned him the first King: which some not understanding, have reputed him the
              founder of
                this
                kingdom by an army of the _Transrhenane Franks_. He might come with such an army,
              but he
                succeeded
                _Theudomir_ by right of blood and consent of the people. For the above cited passage
              of
                _Fredigarius_, _Extinctis Ducibus, in Francis denuo Reges creantur ex eadem stirpe
              quâ prius
                fuerant_, implies that the kingdom continued to this new elected family during the
              reign of
                more
                Kings than one. If you date the years of _Honorius_ from the death of his father,
              the
                reign of
                _Pharamond_ might begin two years later than is assigned by _Bucher_. The _Salique_
              laws
                made in
                his reign, which are yet extant, shew by their name that it was the kingdom of the
              _Salii_
                over
                which he reigned; and, by the pecuniary mulcts in them, that the place where he
              reigned
                abounded
                much with money, and consequently was within the Empire; rude _Germany_ knowing not
              the
                use of
                money, till they mixed with the _Romans_. In the Preface also to the _Salique_ laws,
              written and
                prefixed to them soon after the conversion of the _Franks_ to the Christian
              religion, that
                is, in
                the end of the reign of _Merovæus_, or soon after, the original of this kingdom is
              thus
                described:
                _Hæc enim gens, quæ fortis dum esset &amp; robore valida, Romanorum jugum durissimum
              de
                suis
                cervicibus excussit pugnando_, &amp;c. This kingdom therefore was erected, not by
              invasion
                but by
                rebellion, as was described above. _Prosper_ in registering their Kings in order,
              tells
                us:
                _Pharamundus regnat in Francia; Clodio regnat in Francia; Merovæus regnat in
              Francia_: and
                who can
                imagine but that in all these places he meant one and the same _Francia_? And yet
              'tis
                certain
                that the _Francia_ of _Merovæus_ was in _Gallia_. </p><p id="98006010"> Yet the father of
              _Pharamond_,
                being king
                of a body of _Franks_ in _Germany_ in the reign of the Emperor _Theodosius_, as
              above,
                _Pharamond_
                might reign over the same _Franks_ in _Germany_ before he succeeded _Theudomir_ in
              the
                kingdom of
                the _Salians_ within the Empire, and even before _Theudomir_ began his reign;
              suppose in
                the first
                year of _Honorius_, or when those _Franks_ being repulsed by _Stilico_, lost their
              Kings
                _Marcomir_ and _Suno_, one of which was the father of _Pharamond_: and the _Roman
              Franks_,
                after
                the death of _Theudomir_, might invite _Pharamond_ with his people from beyond the
              _Rhine_. But we
                are not to regard the reign of _Pharamond_ in _Germany_: we are to date this kingdom
              from
                its rise
                within the Empire, and to look upon it as strengthened by the access of other
              _Franks_
                coming from
                beyond the _Rhine_, whether in the reign of this King or in that of his successor
              _Clodio_. For in
                the last year of _Pharamond_'s reign, _Ætius_ took from him a part of his possession
              in
                _Gallia_:
                but his successor _Clodio_, whom _Fredigarius_ represents as the son of _Theudomir_,
              and
                some call
                _Clogio_, _Cloio_, and _Claudius_, inviting from beyond the _Rhine_ a great body of
              _Franks_,
                recovered all, and carried on their conquests as far as the river _Soame_. Then
              those
                _Franks_
                dividing conquests with him, erected certain new kingdoms at _Cologn_ and _Cambray_,
              and
                some
                other cities: all which were afterwards conquered by _Clodovæus_, who also drove the
              _Goths_ out
                of _Gallia_, and fix'd his seat at _Paris_, where it has continued ever since. And
              this
                was the
                original of the present kingdom of _France_.</p>
            </item>
            <item>The Kings of _Britain_ were, A.C. 407 or 408, _Marcus_, _Gratian_, and
              _Constantine_ successively; A.C. 425 _Vortigern_, 466 _Aurelius Ambrosius_, 498 _Uther
              Pendraco_, 508 _Arthur_, 542 _Constantinus_, 545 _Aurelius Cunanus_, 578
              _Vortiporeus_, 581 _Malgo_, 586 _Careticus_, 613 _Cadwan_, 635 _Cadwalin_, 676
              _Cadwallader_. The three first were _Roman_ Tyrants, who revolted from the Empire.
              _Orosius_, _Prosper_ and _Zosimus_ connect their revolt with the irruptions of the
              _Barbarians_ into _Gallia_, as consequent thereunto. _Prosper_, with whom _Zosimus_
              agrees, puts it in the year which began the day after that irruption. The just time I
              thus collect: _Marcus_ reigned not many days, _Gratian_ four months, and _Constantine_
              three years. He was slain the year after the taking of _Rome_, that is A.C. 411, 14
              Kal. _Octob._ Whence the revolt was in Spring A.C. 408. _Sozomen_ joins
              _Constantine_'s expedition into _Gallia_ with _Arcadius_'s death, or the times a
              little after; and _Arcadius_ died A.C. 408 _May_ the 1st. Now tho the reign of these
              Tyrants was but short, yet they gave a beginning to the kingdom of _Britain_, and so
              may be reckoned the three first Kings, especially since the posterity of
              _Constantine_, viz. his sons _Aurelius Ambrosius_, and _Uther Pendraco_, and his
              grandson _Arthur_, reigned afterwards. For from the time of the revolt of these
              Tyrants _Britain_ continued a distict kingdom absolved from subjection to the Empire,
              the Emperor not being able to spare soldiers to be sent thither to receive and keep
              the Island, and therefore neglecting it; as we learn by unquestionable records. For
              _Prosper_ tells us; _A.C._ 410, _Variane Cos. Hac tempestate præ valetudine Romanorum,
              vires funditùs attenuatæ Britanniæ_. And _Sigebert_, conjoining this with the siege of
              _Rome_, saith: _Britannorum vires attenuatæ, &amp; substrahunt se à Romanorum
              dominatione_. And _Zosimus_ _lib._ 6. _The _Transrhenane Barbarians_ invading all
              places, reduced the inhabitants of the island of _Britain_, and also certain _Celtic_
              nations to that pass, that they fell off from the _Roman_ Empire; and being no longer
              obedient to the _Roman_ laws_, [Greek: kat' heauton biateuein], _they lived in
              separate bodies after their own pleasure. The _Britons_ therefore taking up arms, and
              hazarding themselves for their own safety, freed their cities from the imminent
              _Barbarians_. In like manner all _Brabant_ and some other Provinces of the _Gauls_
              imitating the _Britons_, freed themselves also, ejecting the _Roman_ Presidents, and
              forming themselves into a sort of commonwealth according to their own pleasure. This
              rebellion of _Britain_ and the _Celtic_ nations happened when _Constantine_ usurped
              the kingdom_. So also _Procopius_, _lib._ 1. _Vandal._ speaking of the same
              _Constantine_, saith: Constantine _being overcome in battle, was slain with his
              children:_ [Greek: Bretannian men toi Rômaioi anasôsasthai ouketi echon; all' ousa
              hypo tyrannous ap' autou emene.] _Yet the _Romans_ could not recover _Britain_ any
              more, but from that time it remained under Tyrants_. And _Beda_, l. 1. _c._ 11.
              _Fracta est Roma à Gothis anno 1164 suæ conditionis; ex quo tempore Romani in
              Britannia regnare cessaverunt_. And _Ethelwaldus_: _A tempore Romæ à Gothis expugnatæ,
              cessavit imperium Romanorum à Britannia insula, &amp; ab aliis; quas sub jugo
              servitutis tenebant, multis terris_. And _Theodoret_, _serm._ 9. _de curand. Græc.
              affect_. about the year 424, reckons the _Britons_ among the nations which were not
              then in subjection to the _Roman_ Empire. Thus _Sigonius_: _ad annum 411, Imperium
              Romanorum post excessum Constantini in Britannia nullum fuit_.<p id="98006011"> Between the
                death of _Constantine_ and the reign of
                _Vortigern_ was an interregnum of about 14 years, in which the _Britons_ had wars
              with the
                _Picts_
                and _Scots_, and twice obtained the assistance of a _Roman_ Legion, who drove out
              the
                enemy, but
                told them positively at their departure that they would come no more. Of
              _Vortigern_'s
                beginning
                to reign there is this record in an old Chronicle in _Nennius_, quoted by _Camden_
              and
                others:
                _Guortigernus tenuit imperium in Britannia, Theodosio &amp; Valentiniano Coss._
              [viz. A.C.
                425.]
                _&amp; in quarto anno regni sui Saxones ad Britanniam venerunt, Felice &amp; Tauro
              Coss._
                [viz.
                A.C. 428.] This coming of the _Saxons_, _Sigebert_ refers to the 4th year of
              _Valentinian_, which
                falls in with the year 428 assigned by this Chronicle: and two years after, the
              _Saxons_
                together
                with the _Picts_ were beaten by the _Britons_. Afterwards in the reign of _Martian_
              the
                Emperor,
                that is, between the years 450 and 456, the _Saxons_ under _Hengist_ were called in
              by the
                _Britons_, but six years after revolted from them, made war upon them with various
              success,
                and by
                degrees succeeded them. Yet the _Britons_ continued a flourishing kingdom till the
              reign
                of
                _Careticus_; and the war between the two nations continued till the pontificate of
              _Sergius_ A.C.
                688.[2] </p></item>

            <item>
              <p id="98006012">The Kings of the _Hunns_ were, A.C. 406 _Octar_ and _Rugila_, 433 _Bleda_ and
                _Attila_. _Octar_ and _Rugila_ were the brothers of _Munzuc_ King of the _Hunns_ in
                _Gothia_ beyond the _Danube_; and _Bleda_ and _Attila_ were his sons, and _Munzuc_
                was the son of _Balamir_. The two first, as _Jornandes_ tells us, were Kings of the
                _Hunns_, but not of them all; and had the two last for their successors. I date the
                reign of the _Hunns_ in _Pannonia_ from the time that the _Vandals_ and _Alans_
                relinquished _Pannonia_ to them, A.C. 407. _Sigonius_ from the time that the
                _Visigoths_ relinquished _Pannonia_ A. C. 408. _Constat_, saith he, _quod Gothis ex
                Illyrico profectis, Hunni successerunt, atque imprimis Pannoniam tenuerunt. Neque
                enim Honorius viribus ad resistendum in tantis difficultatibus destitutus, prorsus
                eos prohibere potuit, sed meliore consilio, animo ad pacem converso, foedus cum eis,
                datis acceptisque obsidibus fecit; ex quibus qui dati sunt, Ætius, qui etiam Alarico
                tributus fuerat, præcipue memoratur_. How _Ætius_ was hostage to the _Goths_ and
                _Hunns_ is related by _Frigeridus_, who when he had mentioned that _Theodosius_
                Emperor of the _East_ had sent grievous commands to _John_, who after the death of
                _Honorius_ had usurped the crown of the _Western Empire_, he subjoins: _Iis permotus
                Johannes, Ætium id tempus curam palatii gerentem cum ingenti auri pondere ad Chunnos
                transmisit, notos sibi obsidiatûs sui tempore &amp; familiari amicitiâ
                devinctos_--And a little after: _Ætius tribus annis Alarici obses, dehinc Chunnorum,
                postea Carpilionis gener ex Comite domesticorum &amp; Joannis curopalatæ._ Now
                _Bucher_ shews that _Ætius_ was hostage to _Alaric_ till the year 410, when _Alaric_
                died, and to the _Hunns_ between the years 411 and 415, and son-in-law to _Carpilio_
                about the year 417 or 418, and _Curopalates_ to _John_ about the end of the year
                423. Whence 'tis probable that he became hostage to the _Hunns_ about the year 412
                or 413, when _Honorius_ made leagues with almost all the barbarous nations, and
                granted them seats: but I had rather say with _Sigonius_, that _Ætius_ became
                hostage to _Alaric_ A.C. 403. It is further manifest out of _Prosper_, that the
                _Hunns_ were in quiet possession of _Pannonia_ in the year 432. For in the first
                book of _Eusebius_'s Chronicle _Prosper_ writes: <q lang="lat">_Anno
                  decimo post obitum Honorii, cum ad
                  Chunnorum gentem cui tunc Rugila præerat, post prælium cum Bonifacio se Ætius
                contulisset,
                  impetrato auxilio ad Romanorum solum regreditur._</q> And in the second book: <q lang="lat">_Ætio &amp; Valerio
                  Coss. Ætius depositâ potestate profugus ad Hunnos in Pannonia pervenit, quorum
                amicitiâ
                  auxilioque
                  usus, pacem principum interpellatæ potestatis obtinuit._</q> Hereby it appears
                that at this time _Rugila_, or as _Maximus_ calls him, _Rechilla_, reigned over the
                _Hunns_ in _Pannonia_; and that _Pannonia_ was not now so much as accounted within
                the soil of the Empire, being formerly granted away to the _Hunns_; and that these
                were the very same body of _Hunns_ with which _Ætius_ had, in the time of his being
                an hostage, contracted friendship: by virtue of which, as he sollicited them before
                to the aid of _John_ the Tyrant A.C. 424, so now he procured their intercession for
                himself with the Emperor. _Octar_ died A.C. 430; for _Socrates_ tells us, that about
                that time the _Burgundians_ having been newly vext by the _Hunns_, upon intelligence
                of _Octar_'s death, seeing them without a leader, set upon them suddenly with so
                much vigour, that 3000 _Burgundians_ slew 10000 _Hunns_. Of _Rugila_'s being now
                King in _Pannonia_ you have heard already. He died A.C. 433, and was succeeded by
                _Bleda_, as _Prosper_ and _Maximus_ inform us. This _Bleda_ with his brother
                _Attila_ were before this time Kings of the _Hunns_ beyond the _Danube_, their
                father _Munzuc_'s kingdom being divided between them; and now they united the
                kingdom _Pannonia_ to their own. Whence _Paulus Diaconus_ saith, they did _regnum
                intra Pannoniam Daciamque gerere_. In the year 441, they began to invade the Empire
                afresh, adding to the _Pannonian_ forces new and great armies from _Scythia_. But
                this war was presently composed, and then _Attila_, seeing _Bleda_ inclined to
                peace, slew him, A.C. 444, inherited his dominions, and invaded the Empire again. At
                length, after various great wars with the _Romans_, _Attila_ perished A.C. 454; and
                his sons quarrelling about his dominions, gave occasion to the _Gepides_,
                _Ostrogoths_ and other nations who were their subjects, to rebel and make war upon
                them. The same year the _Ostrogoths_ had seats granted them in _Pannonia_ by the
                Emperors _Marcian_ and _Valentinian_; and with the _Romans_ ejected the _Hunns_ out
                of _Pannonia_, soon after the death of _Attila_, as all historians agree. This
                ejection was in the reign of _Avitus_, as is mentioned in the _Chronicum Boiorum_,
                and in _Sidonius, Carm. 7 in Avitum_, which speaks thus of that Emperor.</p>

                receptæ

                the year 378 or 379 to the year 427, and then were driven out of it. But this is a
                plain mistake: for it is certain that the Emperor _Theodosius_ left the Empire
                entire; and we have shewed out of _Prosper_, that the _Hunns_ were in quiet
                possession of _Pannonia_ in the year 432. The _Visigoths_ in those days had nothing
                to do with _Pannonia_, and the _Ostrogoths_ continued subject to the _Hunns_ till
                the death of _Attila_, A.C. 454; and _Valia_ King of the _Visigoths_ did not reign
                twelve years. He began his reign in the end of the year 415, reigned three years,
                and was slain A.C. 419, as _Idacius_, _Isidorus_, and the _Spanish_ manuscript
                Chronicles seen by _Grotius_ testify. And _Olympiodorus_, who carries his history
                only to the year 425, sets down therein the death of _Valia_ King of the
                _Visigoths_, and conjoins it with that of _Constantius_ which happened A.C. 420.
                Wherefore the _Valia_ of _Jornandes_, who reigned at the least twelve years, is some
                other King. And I suspect that this name hath been put by mistake for _Valamir_ King
                of the _Ostrogoths_: for the action recorded was of the _Romans_ and _Ostrogoths_
                driving the _Hunns_ out of _Pannonia_ after the death of _Attila_; and it is not
                likely that the historian would refer the history of the _Ostrogoths_ to the years
                of the _Visigothic_ Kings. This action happened in the end of the year 455, which I
                take to be the twelfth year of _Valamir_ in _Pannonia_, and which was almost fifty
                years after the year 406, in which the _Hunns_ succeeded the _Vandals_ and _Alans_
                in _Pannonia_. Upon the ceasing of the line of _Hunnimund_ the son of _Hermaneric_,
                the _Ostrogoths_ lived without Kings of their own nation about forty years together,
                being subject to the _Hunns_. And when _Alaric_ began to make war upon the _Romans_,
                which was in the year 444, he made _Valamir_, with his brothers _Theodomir_ and
                _Videmir_ the grandsons of _Vinethar_, captains or kings of these _Ostrogoths_ under
                him. In the twelfth year of _Valamir_'s reign dated from thence, the _Hunns_ were
                driven out of _Pannonia_. </p>
              <p id="98006018"> Yet the _Hunns_ were not so ejected, but that they
                had further contests with the _Romans_, till the head of _Denfix_ the son of
                _Attila_, was
                carried
                to _Constantinople_, A.C. 469, in the Consulship of _Zeno_ and _Marcian_, as
                _Marcellinus_
                relates. Nor were they yet totally ejected the Empire: for besides their reliques in
                _Pannonia_,
                _Sigonius_ tells us, that when the Emperors _Marcian_ and _Valentinian_ granted
                _Pannonia_
                to the
                _Goths_, which was in the year 454, they granted part of _Illyricum_ to some of the
                _Hunns_ and
                _Sarmatians_. And in the year 526, when the _Lombards_ removing into _Pannonia_ made
                war
                there
                with the _Gepides_, the _Avares_, a part of the _Hunns_, who had taken the name of
                _Avares_ from
                one of their Kings, assisted the _Lombards_ in that war; and the _Lombards_
                afterwards,
                when they
                went into _Italy_, left their seats in _Pannonia_ to the _Avares_ in recompence of
                their
                friendship. From that time the _Hunns_ grew again very powerful; their Kings, whom
                they
                called
                _Chagan_, troubling the Empire much in the reigns of the Emperors _Mauritius_,
                _Phocas_,
                and
                _Heraclius_: and this is the original of the present kingdom of _Hungary_, which
                from
                these
                _Avares_ and other _Hunns_ mixed together, took the name of _Hun-Avaria_, and by
                contraction
                _Hungary_. </p>

            <item>
              <p id="98006019">The _Lombards_, before they came over the _Danube_, were commanded by two captains,
                _Ibor_ and _Ayon_: after whose death they had Kings, _Agilmund_, _Lamisso_, _Lechu_,
                _Hildehoc_,
                _Gudehoc_, _Classo_, _Tato_, _Wacho_, _Walter_, _Audoin_, _Alboin_, _Cleophis_,
                &amp;c.
                _Agilmund_
                was the son of _Ayon_, who became their King, according to _Prosper_, in the
                Consulship of
                _Honorius_ and _Theodosius_ A.C. 389, reigned thirty three years, according to
                _Paulus
                Warnefridus_, and was slain in battle by the _Bulgarians_. _Prosper_ places his
                death in
                the
                Consulship of _Marinianus_ and _Asclepiodorus_, A.C. 413. _Lamisso_ routed the
                _Bulgarians_, and
                reigned three years, and _Lechu_ almost forty. _Gudehoc_ was contemporary to
                _Odoacer_
                King of the
                _Heruli_ in _Italy_, and led his people from _Pannonia_ into _Rugia_, a country on
                the
                north side
                of _Noricum_ next beyond the _Danube_; from whence _Odoacer_ then carried his people
                into
                _Italy_.
                _Tato_ overthrew the kingdom of the _Heruli_ beyond the _Danube_. _Wacho_ conquered
                the
                _Suevians_, a kingdom then bounded on the east by _Bavaria_, on the west by
                _France_, and
                on the
                south by the _Burgundians_. _Audoin_ returned into _Pannonia_ A.C. 526, and there
                overcame
                the
                _Gepides_. _Alboin_ A.C. 551 overthrew the kingdom of the _Gepides_, and slew their
                King
                _Chunnimund_: A.C. 563 he assisted the _Greek_ Emperor against _Totila_ King of the
                _Ostrogoths_
                in _Italy_; and A.C. 568 led his people out of _Pannonia_ into _Lombardy_, where
                they
                reigned till
                the year 774. </p>
              <p id="98006020"> According to _Paulus Diaconus_, the _Lombards_ with many other _Gothic_
                nations came into the Empire from beyond the _Danube_ in the reign of _Arcadius_ and
                _Honorius_,
                that is, between the years 395 and 408. But they might come in a little earlier: for
                we
                are told
                that the _Lombards_, under their captains _Ibor_ and _Ayon_, beat the _Vandals_ in
                battle;
                and
                _Prosper_ placeth this victory in the Consulship of _Ausonius_ and _Olybrius_, that
                is,
                A.C. 379.
                Before this war the _Vandals_ had remained quiet forty years in the seats granted
                them in
                _Pannonia_ by _Constantine_ the great. And therefore if these were the same
                _Vandals_,
                this war
                must have been in _Pannonia_; and might be occasioned by the coming of the
                _Lombards_ over
                the
                _Danube_ into _Pannonia_, a year or two before the battle; and so have put an end to
                that
                quiet
                which had lasted forty years. After _Gratian_ and _Theodosius_ had quieted the
                _Barbarians_, they
                might either retire over the _Danube_, or continue quiet under the _Romans_ till the
                death
                of
                _Theodosius_; and then either invade the Empire anew, or throw off all subjection to
                it.
                By their
                wars, first with the _Vandals_, and then with the _Bulgarians_, a _Scythian_ nation
                so
                called from
                the river _Volga_ whence they came; it appears that even in those days they were a
                kingdom
                not
                contemptible. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p id="98006021">These nine kingdoms being rent away, we are next to consider the residue of the
                _Western Empire_. While this Empire continued entire, it was the Beast itself: but
                the
                residue
                thereof is only a part of it. Now if this part be considered as a horn, the reign of
                this
                horn may
                be dated from the translation of the imperial seat from _Rome_ to _Ravenna_, which
                was in
                _October_ A.C. 408. For then the Emperor _Honorius_, fearing that _Alaric_ would
                besiege
                him in
                _Rome_, if he staid there, retired to _Millain_, and thence to _Ravenna_: and the
                ensuing
                siege
                and sacking of _Rome_ confirmed his residence there, so that he and his successors
                ever
                after made
                it their home. Accordingly _Macchiavel_ in his _Florentine_ history writes, that
                _Valentinian_
                having left _Rome_, translated the seat of the Empire to _Ravenna_. </p>
              <p id="98006022"> _Rhætia_ belonged to
                the _Western_ Emperors, so long as that Empire stood; and then it descended, with
                _Italy_
                and the
                _Roman_ Senate, to _Odoacer_ King of the _Heruli_ in _Italy_, and after him to
                _Theoderic_
                King of
                the _Ostrogoths_ and his successors, by the grant of the _Greek_ Emperors. Upon the
                death
                of
                _Valentinian_ the second, the _Alemans_ and _Suevians_ invaded _Rhætia_ A.C. 455.
                But I do
                not
                find they erected any settled kingdom there: for in the year 457, while they were
                yet
                depopulating
                _Rhætia_, they were attacked and beaten by _Burto_ Master of the horse to the
                Emperor
                _Majoranus_;
                and I hear nothing more of their invading _Rhætia_. _Clodovæus_ King of _France_, in
                or
                about the
                year 496, conquered a kingdom of the _Alemans_, and slew their last King _Ermeric_.
                But
                this
                kingdom was seated in _Germany_, and only bordered upon _Rhætia_: for its people
                fled from
                _Clodovæus_ into the neighbouring kingdom of the _Ostrogoths_ under _Theoderic_, who
                received them
                as friends, and wrote a friendly letter to _Clodovæus_ in their behalf: and by this
                means
                they
                became inhabitants of _Rhætia_, as subjects under the dominion of the _Ostrogoths_. </p>
              <p id="98006023"> When
                the _Greek_ Emperor conquered the _Ostrogoths_, he succeeded them in the kingdom of
                _Ravenna_, not
                only by right of conquest but also by right of inheritance, the _Roman_ Senate still
                going
                along
                with this kingdom. Therefore we may reckon that this kingdom continued in the
                Exarchate of
                _Ravenna_ and Senate of _Rome_: for the remainder of the _Western Empire_ went along
                with
                the
                Senate of _Rome_, by reason of the right which this Senate still retained, and at
                length
                exerted,
                of chusing a new _Western_ Emperor. </p>
              <p id="98006024"> I have now enumerated the ten kingdoms, into which the
                _Western Empire_ became divided at its first breaking, that is, at the time of
                _Rome_'s
                being
                besieged and taken by the _Goths_. Some of these kingdoms at length fell, and new
                ones
                arose: but
                whatever was their number afterwards, they are still called the _Ten Kings_ from
                their
                first
                number.</p>
