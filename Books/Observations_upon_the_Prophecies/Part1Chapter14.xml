          <head>Of the _Mahuzzims_, honoured by the King who doth according to his will.</head>
          <p id="98014002">
            In scripture we are told of some _trusting in God_ and others _trusting in
            idols_, and that _God is our refuge, our strength, our defense_. In this
            sense God is _the rock of his people_, and false Gods are called _the rock
            of those that trust in them_, Deut. xxxii. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37. In the
            same sense the Gods of _the King_ who _shall do according to his will_ are
            called _Mahuzzims_, munitions, fortresses, protectors, guardians, or
            defenders. _In his estate_, saith [1] _Daniel_, _shall he honour
            _Mahuzzims_; even with a God whom his fathers knew not, shall he honour
            them with gold and silver, and with precious stones, and things of value.
            Thus shall he do in the most strong holds_ or temples;--_and he shall cause
            them to rule over many, and divide the land_ among them _for a possession_.
            Now this came to pass by degrees in the following manner.
          </p>
          <p id="98014003">
            _Gregory Nyssen_ [2] tells us, that after the persecution of the Emperor
            _Decius_, _Gregory_ Bishop of _Neocæsarea_ in _Pontus_, _instituted among
            all people, as an addition or corollary of devotion towards God, that
            festival days and assemblies should be celebrated to them who had contended
            for the faith_, that is, to the _Martyrs_. And he adds this reason for the
            institution: _When he observed_, saith _Nyssen_, _that the simple and
            unskilful multitude, by reason of corporeal delights, remained in the error
            of idols; that the principal thing might be corrected among them, namely,
            that instead of their vain worship they might turn their eyes upon God; he
            permitted that at the memories of the holy Martyrs they might make merry
            and delight themselves, and be dissolved into joy_. The heathens were
            delighted with the festivals of their Gods, and unwilling to part with
            those delights; and therefore _Gregory_, to facilitate their conversion,
            instituted annual festivals to the _Saints_ and _Martyrs_. Hence it came to
            pass, that for exploding the festivals of the heathens, the principal
            festivals of the _Christians_ succeeded in their room: as the keeping of
            _Christmas_ with ivy and feasting, and playing and sports, in the room of
            the _Bacchanalia_ and _Saturnalia_; the celebrating of _May-day_ with
            flowers, in the room of the _Floralia_; and the keeping of festivals to the
            Virgin _Mary_, _John_ the Baptist, and divers of the Apostles, in the room
            of the solemnities at the entrance of the Sun into the signs of the
            _Zodiac_ in the old _Julian_ Calendar. In the same persecution of _Decius_,
            _Cyprian_ ordered the passions of the Martyrs in _Africa_ to be registred,
            in order to celebrate their memories annually with oblations and
            sacrifices: and _Felix_ Bishop of _Rome_, a little after, as _Platina_
            relates, _Martyrum gloria consulens, constituit at quotannis sacrificia
            eorum nomine celebrarentur_; "consulting the glory of the Martyrs, ordained
            that sacrifices should be celebrated annually in their name." By the
            pleasures of these festivals the _Christians_ increased much in number, and
            decreased as much in virtue, until they were _purged and made white_ by the
            persecution of _Dioclesian_. This was the first step made in the
            _Christian_ religion towards the veneration of the Martyrs: and tho it did
            not yet amount to an unlawful worship; yet it disposed the _Christians_
            towards such a further veneration of the dead, as in a short time ended in
            the invocation of Saints.
          </p>
          <p id="98014004">
            The next step was the affecting to pray at the sepulchres of the Martyrs:
            which practice began in _Dioclesian_'s persecution. The Council of
            _Eliberis_ in _Spain_, celebrated in the third or fourth year of
            _Dioclesian_'s persecution, A.C. 305, hath these Canons. Can. 34. _Cereos
            per diem placuit in Coemeterio non incendi: inquietandi enim spiritus
            sanctorum non sunt. Qui hæc non observârint, arceantur ab Ecclesiæ
            communione._ Can. 35. _Placuit prohiberi ne fæminæ in Coemeterio
            pervigilent, eò quod sæpe sub obtentu orationis latentèr scelera
            committant._ Presently after that persecution, suppose about the year 314,
            the Council of _Laodicea_ in _Phrygia_, which then met for restoring the
            lapsed discipline of the Church, has the following Canons. Can. 9. _Those
            of the Church are not allowed to go into the _Coemeteries_ or _Martyries_,
            as they are called, of hereticks, for the sake of prayer or recovery of
            health: but such as go, if they be of the faithful, shall be excommunicated
            for a time_. Can. 34. _A _Christian_ must not leave the Martyrs of
            _Christ_, and go to false Martyrs_, that is, to the Martyrs of the
            hereticks; _for these are alien from God: and therefore let those be
            anathema who go to them_. Can. 51. _The birth-days of the Martyrs shall not
            be celebrated in _Lent_, but their commemoration shall be made on the
            Sabbath-days and Lords days_. The Council of _Paphlagonia_, celebrated in
            the year 324, made this Canon: _If any man being arrogant, abominates the
            congregations of the Martyrs, or the Liturgies performed therein, or the
            memories of the Martyrs, let him be anathema_. By all which it is manifest
            that the _Christians_ in the time of _Dioclesian_'s persecution used to
            pray in the _Coemeteries_ or burying-places of the dead; for avoiding the
            danger of the persecution, and for want of Churches, which were all thrown
            down: and after the persecution was over, continued that practice in honour
            of the Martyrs, till new Churches could be built: and by use affected it as
            advantageous to devotion, and for recovering the health of those that were
            sick. It also appears that in these burying-places they commemorated the
            Martyrs yearly upon days dedicated to them, and accounted all these
            practices pious and religious, and anathematized those men as arrogant who
            opposed them, or prayed in the _Martyries_ of the hereticks. They also
            lighted torches to the Martyrs in the day-time, as the heathens did to
            their Gods; which custom, before the end of the fourth century, prevailed
            much in the _West_. They sprinkled the worshipers of the Martyrs with
            holy-water, as the heathens did the worshipers of their Gods; and went in
            pilgrimage to see _Jerusalem_ and other holy places, as if those places
            conferred sanctity on the visiters. From the custom of praying in the
            _Coemeteries_ and _Martyries_, came the custom of translating the bodies of
            the Saints and Martyrs into such Churches as were new built: the Emperor
            _Constantius_ began this practice about the year 359, causing the bodies of
            _Andrew_ the Apostle, _Luke_ and _Timothy_, to be translated into a new
            Church at _Constantinople_: and before this act of _Constantius_, the
            _Egyptians_ kept the bodies of their Martyrs and Saints unburied upon beds
            in their private houses, and told stories of their souls appearing after
            death and ascending up to heaven, as _Athanasius_ relates in the life of
            _Antony_. All which gave occasion to the Emperor _Julian_, as _Cyril_
            relates, to accuse the _Christians_ in this manner: _Your adding to that
            antient dead man, Jesus, many new dead men, who can sufficiently abominate?
            You have filled all places with sepulchres and monuments, altho you are no
            where bidden to prostrate yourselves to sepulchres, and to respect them
            officiously._ And a little after: _Since _Jesus_ said that sepulchres are
            full of filthiness, how do you invoke God upon them_? and in another place
            he saith, that if _Christians_ had adhered to the precepts of the
            _Hebrews_, _they would have worshiped one God instead of many, and not a
            man, or rather not many unhappy men_: And that they _adored the wood of the
            cross, making its images on their foreheads, and before their houses_.
          </p>
          <p id="98014005"> After the sepulchres of Saints and Martyrs were thus converted into places of worship
            like the heathen temples, and the Churches into sepulchres, and a certain sort of
            sanctity attributed to the dead bodies of the Saints and Martyrs buried in them, and
            annual festivals were kept to them, with sacrifices offered to God in their name; the
            next step towards the invocation of Saints, was the attributing to their dead bodies,
            bones and other reliques, a power of working miracles, by means of the separate souls,
            who were supposed to know what we do or say, and to be able to do us good or hurt, and
            to work those miracles. This was the very notion the heathens had of the separate souls
            of their antient Kings and Heroes, whom they worshiped under the names of _Saturn_,
            _Rhea_, _Jupiter_, _Juno_, _Mars_, _Venus_, _Bacchus_, _Ceres_, _Osiris_, _Isis_,
            _Apollo_, _Diana_, and the rest of their Gods. For these Gods being male and female,
            husband and wife, son and daughter, brother and sister, are thereby discovered to be
            antient men and women. Now as the first step towards the invocation of Saints was set on
            foot by the persecution of _Decius_, and the second by the persecution of _Dioclesian_;
            so this third seems to have been owing to the proceedings of _Constantius_ and _Julian_
            the Apostate. When _Julian_ began to restore the worship of the heathen Gods, and to
            vilify the Saints and Martyrs; the _Christians_ of _Syria_ and _Egypt_ seem to have made
            a great noise about the miracles done by the reliques of the _Christian_ Saints and
            Martyrs, in opposition to the powers attributed by _Julian_ and the heathens to their
            Idols. For _Sozomen_ and _Ruffinus_ tell us, that when he opened the heathen Temples,
            and consulted the Oracle of _Apollo Daphnæus_ in the suburbs of _Antioch_, and pressed
            by many sacrifices for an answer; the Oracle at length told him that the bones of the
            Martyr _Babylas_ which were buried there hinder'd him from speaking. By which answer we
            may understand, that some _Christian_ was got into the place where the heathen Priests
            used to speak thro' a pipe in delivering their Oracles: and before this, _Hilary_ in his
            book against _Constantius_, written in the last year of that Emperor, makes the
            following mention of what was then doing in the _East_ where he was. <q lang="lat" inline="true">_Sine martyrio persequeris.
              Plus crudelitati vestræ _Nero_, _Deci_, _Maximiane_, debemus. Diabolum enim
              per vos vicimus. Sanctus ubique beatorum martyrum sanguis exceptus est, dum
              in his Dæmones mugiunt, dum ægritudines depelluntur, dum miraculorum opera
              cernuntur, elevari sine laqueis corpora, &amp; dispensis pede fæminis vestes
              non defluere in faciem, uri sine ignibus spiritus, confiteri sine
              interrogantis incremento fidei_. And _Gregory Nazianzen_, in his first
              Oration against the Emperor _Julian_ then reigning, writes thus: _Martyres
              non extimuisti quibus præclari honores &amp; festa constituta, à quibus Dæmones
            propelluntur &amp; morbi curantur; quorum sunt apparitiones &amp; prædictiones;
              quorum vel sola corpora idem possunt quod animæ sanctæ, sive manibus
              contrectentur, sive honorentur: quorum vel solæ sanguinis guttæ atque
              exigua passionis signa idem possunt quod corpora. Hæc non colis sed
              contemnis &amp; aspernaris_.</q> These things made the heathens in the reign of the
            same Emperor demolish the sepulchre of _John_ the Baptist in _Phoenicia_, and burn his
            bones; when several _Christians_ mixing themselves with the heathens, gathered up some
            of his remains, which were sent to _Athanasius_, who hid them in the wall of a Church;
            foreseeing by a prophetic spirit, as _Ruffinus_ tells us, that they might be profitable
            to future generations. </p>
          <p id="98014006"> The cry of these miracles being once set on foot, continued for many years, and
            encreased and grew more general. _Chrysostom_, in his second Oration on St. _Babylas_,
            twenty years after the silencing of the Oracle of _Apollo Daphnæus_ as above, viz. A.C.
            382, saith of the miracles done by the Saints and their reliques [3]: <q lang="lat" inline="true">_Nulla est
              nostri hujus Orbis seu regio, seu gens,
              seu urbs, ubi nova &amp; inopinata miracula hæc non decantentur; quæ quidem si
              figmenta fuissent, prorsus in tantam hominum admirationem non venissent_.
              And a little after: _Abunde orationi nostræ fidem faciunt quæ quotidiana à
              martyribus miracula eduntur, magna affatim ad illa hominum multitudine
              affluente_.</q> And in his 66th Homily, describing how the Devils were tormented and
            cast out by the bones of the Martyrs, he adds: <q lang="lat" inline="true">_Ob eam
            causam
              multi plerumque Reges peregrè profecti sunt, ut hoc spectaculo fruerentur.
              Siquidem sanctorum martyrum templa futuri judicii vestigia &amp; signa
              exhibent, dum nimirum Dæmones flagris cæduntur, hominesque torquentur &amp;
              liberantur. Vide quæ sanctorum vitâ functorum vis sit?_</q> And _Jerom_ in his Epitaph
            on _Paula_, thus [4] mentions the same things. _Paula vidit Samariam: <q>ibi siti sunt
            Elisæus
              &amp; Abdias prophetæ, &amp; Joannes Baptista, ubi
              multis intremuit consternata miraculis. Nam cernebat variis dæmones rugire
              cruciatibus, &amp; ante sepulchra sanctorum ululare, homines more luporum
              vocibus latrare canum, fremere leonum, sibilare serpentum, mugire taurorum,
              alios rotare caput &amp; post tergum terram vertice tangere, suspensisque pede
              fæminis vestes non defluere in faciem_.</q> This was about the year 384: and
            _Chrysostom_ in his Oration on the _Egyptian_ Martyrs, seems to make _Egypt_ the
            ringleader in these matters, saying [5]: <q lang="xml" inline="true">_Benedictus Deus
            quandoquidem ex Ægypto prodeunt martyres, ex Ægypto illa cum Deo pugnante
              ac insanissima, &amp; unde impia ora, unde linguæ blasphemæ; ex Ægypto martyres
            habentur; non in Ægypto tantum, nec in finitima vicinaque regione, sed
              _UBIQUE TERRARUM_. Et quemadmodum in annonæ summa ubertate, cum viderunt
              urbium incolæ majorem quam usus habitatorum postulat esse proventum, ad
              peregrinas etiam urbes transmittunt: cum &amp; suam comitatem &amp; liberalitatem
            ostendant, tum ut præter horum abundantiam cum facilitate res quibus
              indigent rursus ab illis sibi comparent: sic &amp; Ægyptii, quod attinet ad
              religionis athletas, fecerunt. Cum apud se multam eorum Dei benignitate
              copiam cernerent, nequaquam ingens Dei munus sua civitate concluserunt, sed
              in _OMNES TERRÆ PARTES_ bonorum thesauros effuderunt: cum ut suum in
              fratres amorem ostenderent, tum ut communem omnium dominum honore
              afficerent, ac civitati suæ gloriam apud omnes compararent, totiusque
              terrarum _ORBIS_ esse _METROPOLIN_ declararent.--Sanctorum enim illorum
              corpora quovis adamantino &amp; inexpugnabili muro tutiùs nobis urbem
              communiunt, &amp; tanquam excelsi quidam scopuli undique prominentes, non horum
              qui sub sensus cadunt &amp; oculis cernuntur hostium impetus propulsant tantùm,
              sed etiam invisibilium dæmonum insidias, omnesque diaboli fraudes
              subvertunt ac dissipant.--Neque vero tantùm adversus hominum insidias aut
              adversus fallacias dæmonum utilis nobis est hæc possessio, sed si nobis
              communis dominus ob peccatorum multitudinem irascatur, his objectis
              corporibus continuo poterimus eum propitium reddere civitati_.</q> This Oration was
            written at _Antioch_, while _Alexandria_ was yet the Metropolis of the _East_, that is,
            before the year 381, in which _Constantinople_ became the Metropolis: and it was a work
            of some years for the _Egyptians_ to have distributed the miracle-working reliques of
            their Martyrs over all the world, as they had done before that year. _Egypt_ abounded
            most with the reliques of Saints and Martyrs, the _Egyptians_ keeping them embalmed upon
            beds even in their private houses; and _Alexandria_ was eminent above all other cities
            for dispersing them, so as on that account to acquire glory with all men, and manifest
            herself to be the _Metropolis_ of the world. _Antioch_ followed the example of _Egypt_,
            in dispersing the reliques of the forty Martyrs: and the examples of _Egypt_ and _Syria_
            were soon followed by the rest of the world. </p>
          <p id="98014007">
            The reliques of the forty Martyrs at _Antioch_ were distributed among the
            Churches before the year 373; for _Athanasius_ who died in that year, wrote
            an Oration upon them. This Oration is not yet published, but _Gerard
            Vossius_ saw it in MS. in the Library of Cardinal _Ascanius_ in _Italy_, as
            he says in his commentary upon the Oration of _Ephræm Syrus_ on the same
            forty Martyrs. Now since the Monks of _Alexandria_ sent the reliques of the
            Martyrs of _Egypt_ into all parts of the earth, and thereby acquired glory
            to their city, and declared her in these matters the Metropolis of the
            whole world, as we have observed out of _Chrysostom_; it may be concluded,
            that before _Alexandria_ received the forty Martyrs from _Antioch_, she
            began to send out the reliques of her own Martyrs into all parts, setting
            the first example to other cities. This practice therefore began in _Egypt_
            some years before the death of _Athanasius_. It began when the
            miracle-working bones of _John_ the Baptist were carried into _Egypt_, and
            hid in the wall of a Church, _that they might be profitable to future
            generations_. It was restrained in the reign of _Julian_ the Apostate: and
            then it spred from _Egypt_ into all the Empire, _Alexandria_ being the
            Metropolis of the whole world, according to _Chrysostom_, for propagating
            this sort of devotion, and _Antioch_ and other cities soon following her
            example.
          </p>
          <p id="98014008">
            In propagating these superstitions, the ring-leaders were the Monks, and
            _Antony_ was at the head of them: for in the end of the life of _Antony_,
            _Athanasius_ relates that these were his dying words to his disciples who
            then attended him. _Do you take care_, said _Antony_, _to adhere to
            _Christ_ in the first place, and then to the Saints, that after death they
            may receive you as friends and acquaintance into the everlasting
            tabernacles, Think upon these things, perceive these things; and if you
            have any regard to me, remember me as a father_. This being delivered in
            charge to the Monks by _Antony_ at his death, A.C. 356, could not but
            inflame their whole body with devotion towards the Saints, as the ready way
            to be received, by them into the eternal Tabernacles after death. Hence
            came that noise about the miracles, done by the reliques of the Saints in
            the time of _Constantius_: hence came the dispersion of the miracle-working
            reliques into all the Empire; _Alexandria_ setting the example, and being
            renowned, for it above all other cities. Hence it came to pass in the days
            of _Julian_, A.C. 362, that _Athanasius_ by a prophetic spirit, as
            _Ruffinus_ tells us, hid the bones of _John_ the Baptist from the Heathens,
            not in the ground to be forgotten, but in the hollow wall of a Church
            before proper witnesses, that they might _be profitable to future
            generations_. Hence also came the invocation of the Saints for doing such
            miracles, and for assisting men in their devotions, and mediating with God.
            For _Athanasius_, even from his youth, looked upon the dead Saints and
            Martyrs as mediators of our prayers: in his Epistle to _Marcellinus_,
            written in the days of _Constantine_ the great, he saith that the words of
            the _Psalms_ are not to be transposed or any wise changed, but to be
            recited and sung without any artifice, as they are written, _that the holy
            men who delivered them, knowing them to be their own words, may pray with
            us; or rather, that the Holy Ghost who spake in the holy men, seeing his
            own words with which he inspired them, may join_ with them _in assisting
            us_.

          <p id="98014009"> Whilst _Egypt_ abounded with Monks above any other country, the veneration of the
            Saints began sooner, and spred faster there than in other places. _Palladius_ going into
            _Egypt_ in the year 388 to visit the Monasteries, and the sepulchres of _Apollonius_ and
            other Martyrs of _Thebais_ who had suffered under _Maximinus_, saith of them: _Iis
            omnibus Christiani fecerunt ædem unam, ubi nunc multæ virtutes peraguntur. Tanta autem
            fuit viri gratia, ut de iis quæ esset precatus statim exaudiretur, eum sic honorante
            servatore: quem etiam nos in martyrio precati vidimus, cum iis qui cum ipso fuerunt
            martyrio affecti; &amp; Deum adorantes, eorum corpora salutavimus._ _Eunapius_ also, a
            heathen, yet a competent witness of what was done in his own times, relating how the
            soldiers delivered the temples of _Egypt_ into the hands of the Monks, which was done in
            the year 389, rails thus in an impious manner at the Martyrs, as succeeding in the room
            of the old Gods of _Egypt_. <q lang="lat" inline="true">_Illi ipsi,

            Thus _Basil_ a Monk, who was made Bishop of _Cæsarea_ in the year 369, and
            died in the year 378, in his Oration on the Martyr _Mamas_, saith: _Be ye
            mindful of the Martyr; as many of you as have enjoyed him in your dreams,
            as many as in this place have been assisted by him in prayer, as many of
            you as upon invoking him by name have had him present in your works, as
            many as he has reduced into the way from wandering, as many as he has
            restored to health, as, many as have had their dead children restored by
            him to life, as many as have had their lives prolonged by him_: and a
            little after, he thus expresses the universality of this superstition in
            the regions of _Cappadocia_ and _Bithynia_: _At the memory of the Martyr_,
            saith he, _the whole region is moved; at his festival the whole city is
            transported with joy. Nor do the kindred of the rich turn aside to the
            sepulchres of their ancestors, but all go to the place of devotion._ Again,
            in the end of the Homily he prays, that _God would preserve the Church,
            thus fortified with the great towers of the Martyrs_: and in his Oration on
            the forty Martyrs; _These are they_, saith he, _who obtaining our country,
            like certain towers afford us safety against our enemies. Neither are they
            shut up in one place only, but being distributed are sent into many
            regions, and adorn many countries.--You have often endeavoured, you have
            often laboured to find one who might pray for you: here are forty, emitting
            one voice of prayer.--He that is in affliction flies to these, he that
            rejoices has recourse to these: the first, that he may be freed from evil,
            the last that he may continue in happiness. Here a woman praying for her
            children is heard; she obtains a safe return for her husband from abroad,
            and health for him in his sickness.--O ye common keepers of mankind, the
            best companions of our cares, suffragans and coadjutors of our prayers,
            most powerful embassadors to God_, &amp;c. By all which it is manifest, that
            before the year 378, the Orations and Sermons upon the Saints went much
            beyond the bounds of mere oratorical flourishes, and that the common people
            in the _East_ were already generally corrupted by the Monks with
            Saint-worship.

            _Gregory Nazianzen_ a Monk, in his sixth Oration written A.C. 373, when he
            was newly made Bishop of _Sasima_, saith: _Let us purify ourselves to the
            Martyrs, or rather to the God of the Martyrs_: and a little after he calls
            the Martyrs _mediators of obtaining an ascension or divinity_. The same
            year, in the end of his Oration upon _Athanasius_ then newly dead, he thus
            invokes him: _Do thou look down upon us propitiously, and govern this
            people, as perfect adorers of the perfect Trinity, which in the Father,
            Son, and Holy Ghost, is contemplated and worshiped: if there shall be
            peace, preserve me, and feed my flock with me; but if war, bring me home,
            place me by thyself, and by those that are like thee; however great my
            request._ And in the end of the funeral Oration upon _Basil_, written A.C.
            378, he thus addresses him: _But thou, O divine and sacred Head, look down
            upon us from heaven; and by thy prayers either take away that thorn of the
            flesh which is given us by God for exercise, or obtain that we may bear it
            with courage, and direct all our life to that which is most fitting for us.
            When we depart this life, receive us there in your Tabernacles, that living
            together and beholding the holy and blessed Trinity more purely and
            perfectly, whereof we have now but an imperfect view, we may there come to
            the end of our desires, and receive this reward of the wars which we have
            waged or suffered_: and in his Oration upon _Cyprian_, not the Bishop of
            _Carthage_, but a _Greek_, he invokes him after the same manner; and tells
            us also how a pious Virgin named _Justina_, was protected by invoking the
            Virgin _Mary_, and how miracles were done by the ashes of _Cyprian_.

            _Gregory Nyssen_, another eminent Monk and Bishop, in the life of _Ephræm
            Syrus_, tells how a certain man returning from a far country, was in great
            danger, by reason all the ways were intercepted by the armies of barbarous
            nations; but upon invoking _Ephræm_ by name, and saying, _Holy _Ephræm_
            assist me_, he escaped the danger, neglected the fear of death, and beyond
            his hope got safe home. In the end of this Oration _Gregory_ calls upon
            _Ephræm_ after the following manner: _But thou, O Ephræm, assisting now at
            the divine altar, and sacrificing to the Prince of life, and to the most
            holy Trinity, together with the Angels; remember us all, and obtain for us
            pardon of our sins, that we may enjoy the eternal happiness of the kingdom
            of heaven._ The same _Gregory_, in his Oration on the Martyr _Theodorus_
            written A.C. 381, thus describes the power of that Martyr, and the practice
            of the people. _This Martyr_, saith he, _the last year quieted the
            barbarous tempest, and put a stop to the horrid war of the fierce and cruel
            _Scythians_.--If any one is permitted to carry away the dust with which the
            tomb is covered, wherein the body of the Martyr rests; the dust is accepted
            as a gift, and gathered to be laid up as a thing of great price. For to
            touch the reliques themselves, if any such prosperous fortune shall at any
            time happen; how great a favour that is, and not to be obtained without the
            most earnest prayers, they know well who have obtained it. For as a living
            and florid body, they who behold it embrace it, applying to it the eyes,
            mouth, ears, and all the organs of sense; and then with affection pouring
            tears upon the Martyr, as if he was whole and appeared to them: they offer
            prayers with supplication, that he would intercede for them as an advocate,
            praying to him as an Officer attending upon God, and invoking him as
            receiving gifts whenever he will._ At length _Gregory_ concludes the
            Oration with this prayer: _O Theodorus, we want many blessings; intercede
            and beseech for thy country before the common King and Lord: for the
            country of the Martyr is the place of his passion, and they are his
            citizens, brethren and kindred, who have him, defend, adorn and honour him.
            We fear afflictions, we expect dangers: the wicked _Scythians_ are not far
            off, ready to make war against us. As a soldier fight for us, as a Martyr
            use liberty of speech for thy fellow-servants. Pray for peace, that these
            publick meetings may not cease, that the furious and wicked barbarian may
            not rage against the temples and altars, that the profane and impious may
            not trample upon the holy things. We acknowledge it a benefit received from
            thee, that we are preserved safe and entire, we pray for freedom from
            danger in time to come: and if there shall be need of greater intercession
            and deprecation, call together the choir of thy brethren the Martyrs, and
            in conjunction with them all intercede for us. Let the prayers of many just
            ones attone for the sins of the multitudes and the people; exhort _Peter_,
            excite _Paul_, and also _John_ the divine and beloved disciple, that they
            may be sollicitous for the Churches which they have erected, for which they
            have been in chains, for which they have undergone dangers and deaths; that
            the worship of idols may not lift up its head against us, that heresies may
            not spring up like thorns in the vineyard, that tares grown up may not
            choak the wheat, that no rock void of the fatness of true dew may be
            against us, and render the fruitful power of the word void of a root; but
            by the power of the prayers of thyself and thy companions, O admirable man
            and eminent among the Martyrs, the commonwealth of _Christians_ may become
            a field of corn_. The same _Gregory Nyssen_, in his sermon upon the death
            of _Meletius_ Bishop of _Antioch_, preached at _Constantinople_ the same
            year, A.C. 381, before the Bishops of all the _East_ assembled in the
            second general Council, spake thus of _Meletius_. _The Bridegroom_, saith
            he, _is not taken from us: he stands in the midst of us, tho we do not see
            him: he is a Priest in the most inward places, and face to face intercedes
            before God for us and the sins of the people_. This was no oratorical
            flourish, but _Gregory_'s real opinion, as may be understood by what we
            have cited out of him concerning _Ephræm_ and _Theodorus_: and as _Gregory_
            preached this before the Council of _Constantinople_, you may thence know,
            saith [6] _Baronius_, that he professed what the whole Council, and
            therewith the whole Church of those parts believed, namely, that the Saints
            in heaven offer prayers for us before God.

            _Ephræm Syrus_, another eminent Monk, who was contemporary with _Basil_,
            and died the same year; in the end of his Encomium or Oration upon _Basil_
            then newly dead, invokes him after this manner: _Intercede for me, a very
            miserable man; and recal me by thy intercessions, O father; thou who art
            strong, pray for me who am weak; thou who art diligent, for me who am
            negligent; thou who art chearful, for me who am heavy; thou who art wise,
            for me who am foolish. Thou who hast treasured up a treasure of all
            virtues, be a guide to me who am empty of every good work_. In the
            beginning of his Encomium upon the forty Martyrs, written at the same time,
            he thus invokes them: _Help me therefore, O ye Saints, with your
            intercession; and O ye beloved, with your holy prayers, that _Christ_ by
            his grace may direct my tongue to speak_, &amp;c. and afterwards mentioning the
            mother of one of these forty Martyrs, he concludes the Oration with this
            prayer: _I entreat thee, O holy, faithful, and blessed woman, pray for me
            to the Saints, saying; Intercede ye that triumph in _Christ_, for the most
            little and miserable _Ephræm_, that he may find mercy, and by the grace of
            _Christ_ may be saved_. Again, in his second Sermon or Oration on the
            praises of the holy Martyrs of _Christ_, he thus addresses them: _We
            entreat you most holy Martyrs, to intercede with the Lord for us miserable
            sinners, beset with the filthiness of negligence, that he would infuse his
            divine grace into us_: and afterwards, near the end of the same discourse;
            _Now ye most holy men and glorious Martyrs of God, help me a miserable
            sinner with your prayers, that in that dreadful hour I may obtain mercy,
            when the secrets of all hearts shall be made manifest. I am to day become
            to you, most holy Martyrs of _Christ_, as it were an unprofitable and
            unskilful cup-bearer: for I have delivered to the sons and brothers of your
            faith, a cup of the excellent wine of your warfare, with the excellent
            table of your victory, replenished with all sorts of dainties. I have
            endeavoured, with the whole affection and desire of my mind, to recreate
            your fathers and brothers, kindred and relations, who daily frequent the
            table. For behold they sing, and with exultation and jubilee glorify God,
            who has crown'd your virtues, by setting on your most sacred heads
            incorruptible and celestial crowns; they with excessive joy stand about the
            sacred reliques of your martyrdoms, wishing for a blessing, and desiring to
            bear away holy medicines both for the body and the mind. As good disciples
            and faithful ministers of our benign Lord and Saviour, bestow therefore a
            blessing on them all: and on me also, tho weak and feeble, who having
            received strength by your merits and intercessions, have with the whole
            devotion of my mind, sung a hymn to your praise and glory before your holy
            reliques. Wherefore I beseech you stand before the throne of the divine
            Majesty for me _Ephræm_, a vile and miserable sinner, that by your prayers
            I may deserve to obtain salvation, and with you enjoy eternal felicity by
            the grace and benignity and mercy of our Lord and Saviour _Jesus Christ_,
            to whom with the Father and Holy Ghost be praise, honour and glory for ever
            and ever_. Amen.

            By what has been cited out of _Basil_, the two _Gregories_ and _Ephræm_, we
            may understand that Saint-worship was established among the Monks and their
            admirers in _Egypt_, _Phoenicia_, _Syria_ and _Cappadocia_, before the year
            378, this being the year in which _Basil_ and _Ephræm_ died. _Chrysostom_
            was not much later; he preached at _Antioch_ almost all the time of
            _Theodosius_ the great, and in his Sermons are many exhortations to this
            sort of superstition, as may be seen in the end of his Orations on S.
            _Julia_, on St. _Pelagia_, on the Martyr _Ignatius_, on the _Egyptian_
            Martyrs, on Fate and Providence, on the Martyrs in general, on St.
            _Berenice_ and St. _Prosdoce_, on _Juventinus_ and _Maximus_, on the name
            of _Coemetery_, &amp;c. Thus in his Sermon on _Berenice_ and _Prosdoce_:
            _Perhaps_, saith he, _you are inflamed with no small love towards these
            Martyrs; therefore with this ardour let us fall down before their reliques,
            let us embrace their coffins. For the coffins of the Martyrs have great
            virtue, even as the bones of the Martyrs have great power. Nor let us only
            on the day of this festival, but also on other days apply to them, invoke
            them, and beseech them to be our patrons: for they have great power and
            efficacy, not only whilst alive, but also after death; and much more after
            death than before. For now they bear the marks or brands of _Christ_; and
            when they shew these marks, they can obtain all things of the King. Seeing
            therefore they abound with such efficacy, and have so much friendship with
            him; we also, when by continual attendance and perpetual visitation of them
            we have insinuated ourselves into their familiarity, may by their
            assistance obtain the mercy of God_.
          </p>
          <p id="98014015">
            _Constantinople_ was free from these superstitions till _Gregory Nazianzen_
            came thither A.D. 379; but in a few years it was also inflamed with it.
            _Ruffinus_ [7] tells us, that when the Emperor _Theodosius_ was setting out
            against the tyrant _Eugenius_, which was in the year 394, he went about
            with the Priests and people to all the places of prayer; lay prostrate in
            haircloth before the shrines of the Martyrs and Apostles, and pray'd for
            assistance by the intercession of the Saints. _Sozomen_ [8] adds, that when
            the Emperor was marched seven miles from _Constantinople_ against
            _Eugenius_, he went into a Church which he had built to _John_ the Baptist,
            _and invoked the Baptist for his assistance. Chrysostom_ [9] says: _He that
            is clothed in purple, approaches to embrace these sepulchres; and laying
            aside his dignity, stands supplicating the Saints to intercede for him with
            God: and he who goes crowned with a diadem, offers his prayers to the
            tent-maker and the fisher-man as his Protestors._ And in [10] another
            place: _The cities run together to the sepulchres of the Martyrs, and the
            people are inflamed with the love of them_.
          </p>
          <p id="98014016"> This practice of sending reliques from place to place for working miracles, and
            thereby inflaming the devotion of the nations towards the dead Saints and their
            reliques, and setting up the religion of invoking their souls, lasted only till the
            middle of the reign of the Emperor _Theodosius_ the great; for he then prohibited it by
            the following Edict. _Humatum corpus, nemo ad alterum locum transferat; nemo Martyrem
            distrahat, nemo mercetur: Habeant verò in potestate, si quolibet in loco sanctorum est
            aliquis conditus, pro ejus veneratione, quod _Martyrium_ vocandum sit, addant quod

            Euodio Coss._ A.C. 386. After this they filled the fields and high-ways with altars
            erected to Martyrs, which they pretended to discover by dreams and revelations: and this
            occasioned the making the fourteenth Canon of the fifth Council of _Carthage_, A.C. 398. <q lang="lat" inline="true">_Item placuit, ut

              reprobentur._</q> These altars were for invoking the Saints or Martyrs buried or
            pretended to be buried under them. First they filled the Churches in all places with the
            reliques or pretended reliques of the Martyrs, for invoking them in the Churches; and
            then they filled the fields and high-ways with altars, for invoking them every where:
            and this new religion was set up by the Monks in all the _Greek_ Empire before the
            expedition of the Emperor _Theodosius_ against _Eugenius_, and I think before his
            above-mentioned Edict, A.C. 386. </p>

            The same religion of worshiping _Mahuzzims_ quickly spred into the _Western
            Empire_ also: but _Daniel_ in this Prophecy describes chiefly the things
            done among the nations comprehended in the body of his third Beast.
