          <header>Of the Prophetic Language.</header>
          <p id="98002002">
            For understanding the Prophecies, we are, in the first place, to acquaint
            our-selves with the figurative language of the Prophets. This language is
            taken from the analogy between the world natural, and an empire or kingdom
            considered as a world politic.
          </p>
          <p id="98002003">
            Accordingly, the whole world natural consisting of heaven and earth,
            signifies the whole world politic, consisting of thrones and people, or so
            much of it as is considered in the Prophecy: and the things in that world
            signify the analogous things in this. For the heavens, and the things
            therein, signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them; and the
            earth, with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the lowest parts
            of the earth, called _Hades_ or Hell, the lowest or most miserable part of
            them. Whence ascending towards heaven, and descending to the earth, are put
            for rising and falling in power and honour: rising out of the earth, or
            waters, and falling into them, for the rising up to any dignity or
            dominion, out of the inferior state of the people, or falling down from the
            same into that inferior state; descending into the lower parts of the
            earth, for descending to a very low and unhappy estate; speaking with a
            faint voice out of the dust, for being in a weak and low condition; moving
            from one place to another, for translation from one office, dignity, or
            dominion, to another; great earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and
            earth, for the shaking of kingdoms, so as to distract or overthrow them;
            the creating a new heaven and earth, and the passing away of an old one, or
            the beginning and end of the world, for the rise and ruin of the body
            politic signified thereby.
          </p>
          <p id="98002004">
            In the heavens, the Sun and Moon are, by interpreters of dreams, put for
            the persons of Kings and Queens; but in sacred Prophecy, which regards not
            single persons, the Sun is put for the whole species and race of Kings, in
            the kingdom or kingdoms of the world politic, shining with regal power and
            glory; the Moon for the body of the common people, considered as the King's
            wife; the Stars for subordinate Princes and great men, or for Bishops and
            Rulers of the people of God, when the Sun is Christ; light for the glory,
            truth, and knowledge, wherewith great and good men shine and illuminate
            others; darkness for obscurity of condition, and for error, blindness and
            ignorance; darkning, smiting, or setting of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, for
            the ceasing of a kingdom, or for the desolation thereof, proportional to
            the darkness; darkning the Sun, turning the Moon into blood, and falling of
            the Stars, for the same; new Moons, for the return of a dispersed people
            into a body politic or ecclesiastic.
          </p>
          <p id="98002005">
            Fire and meteors refer to both heaven and earth, and signify as follows;
            burning any thing with fire, is put for the consuming thereof by war; a
            conflagration of the earth, or turning a country into a lake of fire, for
            the consumption of a kingdom by war; the being in a furnace, for the being
            in slavery under another nation; the ascending up of the smoke of any
            burning thing for ever and ever, for the continuation of a conquered people
            under the misery of perpetual subjection and slavery; the scorching heat of
            the sun, for vexatious wars, persecutions and troubles inflicted by the
            King; riding on the clouds, for reigning over much people; covering the sun
            with a cloud, or with smoke, for oppression of the King by the armies of an
            enemy; tempestuous winds, or the motion of clouds, for wars; thunder, or
            the voice of a cloud, for the voice of a multitude; a storm of thunder,
            lightning, hail, and overflowing rain, for a tempest of war descending from
            the heavens and clouds politic, on the heads of their enemies; rain, if not
            immoderate, and dew, and living water, for the graces and doctrines of the
            Spirit; and the defect of rain, for spiritual barrenness.
          </p>
          <p id="98002006">
            In the earth, the dry land and congregated waters, as a sea, a river, a
            flood, are put for the people of several regions, nations, and dominions;
            embittering of waters, for great affliction of the people by war and
            persecution; turning things into blood, for the mystical death of bodies
            politic, that is, for their dissolution; the overflowing of a sea or river,
            for the invasion of the earth politic, by the people of the waters; drying
            up of waters, for the conquest of their regions by the earth; fountains of
            waters for cities, the permanent heads of rivers politic; mountains and
            islands, for the cities of the earth and sea politic, with the territories
            and dominions belonging to those cities; dens and rocks of mountains, for
            the temples of cities; the hiding of men in those dens and rocks, for the
            shutting up of Idols in their temples; houses and ships, for families,
            assemblies, and towns, in the earth and sea politic; and a navy of ships of
            war, for an army of that kingdom that is signified by the sea.
          </p>
          <p id="98002007">
            Animals also and vegetables are put for the people of several regions and
            conditions; and particularly, trees, herbs, and land animals, for the
            people of the earth politic: flags, reeds, and fishes, for those of the
            waters politic; birds and insects, for those of the politic heaven and
            earth; a forest for a kingdom; and a wilderness for a desolate and thin
            people.
          </p>
          <p id="98002008">
            If the world politic, considered in prophecy, consists of many kingdoms,
            they are represented by as many parts of the world natural; as the noblest
            by the celestial frame, and then the Moon and Clouds are put for the common
            people; the less noble, by the earth, sea, and rivers, and by the animals
            or vegetables, or buildings therein; and then the greater and more powerful
            animals and taller trees, are put for Kings, Princes, and Nobles. And
            because the whole kingdom is the body politic of the King, therefore the
            Sun, or a Tree, or a Beast, or Bird, or a Man, whereby the King is
            represented, is put in a large signification for the whole kingdom; and
            several animals, as a Lion, a Bear, a Leopard, a Goat, according to their
            qualities, are put for several kingdoms and bodies politic; and sacrificing
            of beasts, for slaughtering and conquering of kingdoms; and friendship
            between beasts, for peace between kingdoms. Yet sometimes vegetables and
            animals are, by certain epithets or circumstances, extended to other
            significations; as a Tree, when called the _tree of life_ or _of
            knowledge_; and a Beast, when called _the old serpent_, or worshipped.
          </p>
          <p id="98002009">
            When a Beast or Man is put for a kingdom, his parts and qualities are put
            for the analogous parts and qualities of the kingdom; as the head of a
            Beast, for the great men who precede and govern; the tail for the inferior
            people, who follow and are governed; the heads, if more than one, for the
            number of capital parts, or dynasties, or dominions in the kingdom, whether
            collateral or successive, with respect to the civil government; the horns
            on any head, for the number of kingdoms in that head, with respect to
            military power; seeing for understanding, and the eyes for men of
            understanding and policy, and in matters of religion for [Greek:
            Episkopoi], Bishops; speaking, for making laws; the mouth, for a law-giver,
            whether civil or sacred; the loudness of the voice, for might and power;
            the faintness thereof, for weakness; eating and drinking, for acquiring
            what is signified by the things eaten and drank; the hairs of a beast, or
            man, and the feathers of a bird, for people; the wings, for the number of
            kingdoms represented by the beast; the arm of a man, for his power, or for
            any people wherein his strength and power consists; his feet, for the
            lowest of the people, or for the latter end of the kingdom; the feet,
            nails, and teeth of beasts of prey, for armies and squadrons of armies; the
            bones, for strength, and for fortified places; the flesh, for riches and
            possessions; and the days of their acting, for years; and when a tree is
            put for a kingdom, its branches, leaves and fruit, signify as do the wings,
            feathers, and food of a bird or beast.
          </p>
          <p id="98002010">
            When a man is taken in a mystical sense, his qualities are often signified
            by his actions, and by the circumstances of things about him. So a Ruler is
            signified by his riding on a beast; a Warrior and Conqueror, by his having
            a sword and bow; a potent man, by his gigantic stature; a Judge, by weights
            and measures; a sentence of absolution, or condemnation, by a white or a
            black stone; a new dignity, by a new name; moral or civil qualifications,
            by garments; honour and glory, by splendid apparel; royal dignity, by
            purple or scarlet, or by a crown; righteousness, by white and clean robes;
            wickedness, by spotted and filthy garments; affliction, mourning, and
            humiliation, by clothing in sackcloth; dishonour, shame, and want of good
            works, by nakedness; error and misery, by drinking a cup of his or her wine
            that causeth it; propagating any religion for gain, by exercising traffick
            and merchandize with that people whose religion it is; worshipping or
            serving the false Gods of any nation, by committing adultery with their
            princes, or by worshipping them; a Council of a kingdom, by its image;
            idolatry, by blasphemy; overthrow in war, by a wound of man or beast; a
            durable plague of war, by a sore and pain; the affliction or persecution
            which a people suffers in labouring to bring forth a new kingdom, by the
            pain of a woman in labour to bring forth a man-child; the dissolution of a
            body politic or ecclesiastic, by the death of a man or beast; and the
            revival of a dissolved dominion, by the resurrection of the dead.
