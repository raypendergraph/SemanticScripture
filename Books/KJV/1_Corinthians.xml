        <fragment id="46001002" kind="vs">Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001003" kind="vs">Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001004" kind="vs">I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001005" kind="vs">That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001006" kind="vs">Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001007" kind="vs">So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001008" kind="vs">Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001009" kind="vs">God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001010" kind="vs">Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001011" kind="vs">For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001012" kind="vs">Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001013" kind="vs">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001014" kind="vs">I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001015" kind="vs">Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001016" kind="vs">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001017" kind="vs">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001018" kind="vs">For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001019" kind="vs">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001020" kind="vs">Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001021" kind="vs">For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001022" kind="vs">For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001023" kind="vs">But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001024" kind="vs">But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001025" kind="vs">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001026" kind="vs">For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001027" kind="vs">But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001028" kind="vs">And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001029" kind="vs">That no flesh should glory in his presence.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001030" kind="vs">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46001031" kind="vs">That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46002002" kind="vs">For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002003" kind="vs">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002004" kind="vs">And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002005" kind="vs">That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002006" kind="vs">Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002007" kind="vs">But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002008" kind="vs">Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002009" kind="vs">But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002010" kind="vs">But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002011" kind="vs">For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002012" kind="vs">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002013" kind="vs">Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002014" kind="vs">But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002015" kind="vs">But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46002016" kind="vs">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46003002" kind="vs">I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003003" kind="vs">For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003004" kind="vs">For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003005" kind="vs">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</fragment>

        <fragment id="46003008" kind="vs">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003009" kind="vs">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003010" kind="vs">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46003012" kind="vs">Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003013" kind="vs">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003014" kind="vs">If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003015" kind="vs">If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003016" kind="vs">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003017" kind="vs">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003018" kind="vs">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46003019" kind="vs">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46004003" kind="vs">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46004013" kind="vs">Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46004015" kind="vs">For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46004017" kind="vs">For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46004018" kind="vs">Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="46004019" kind="vs">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46015039" kind="vs">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46015041" kind="vs">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</fragment>

        <fragment id="46015054" kind="vs">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</fragment>
