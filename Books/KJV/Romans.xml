        <fragment id="45001003" kind="vs">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001004" kind="vs">And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001005" kind="vs">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001006" kind="vs">Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001007" kind="vs">To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001008" kind="vs">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001009" kind="vs">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001010" kind="vs">Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001011" kind="vs">For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001012" kind="vs">That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001013" kind="vs">Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001014" kind="vs">I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001015" kind="vs">So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001016" kind="vs">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001017" kind="vs">For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001018" kind="vs">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001019" kind="vs">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001020" kind="vs">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001021" kind="vs">Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001022" kind="vs">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001023" kind="vs">And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001024" kind="vs">Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001025" kind="vs">Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001026" kind="vs">For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001027" kind="vs">And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001028" kind="vs">And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001029" kind="vs">Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001030" kind="vs">Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001031" kind="vs">Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45001032" kind="vs">Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</fragment>

        <fragment id="45002002" kind="vs">But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</fragment>

        <fragment id="45002010" kind="vs">But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002011" kind="vs">For there is no respect of persons with God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002012" kind="vs">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002013" kind="vs">For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002014" kind="vs">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002015" kind="vs">Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002016" kind="vs">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002017" kind="vs">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002018" kind="vs">And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002019" kind="vs">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002020" kind="vs">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002021" kind="vs">Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</fragment>

        <fragment id="45002023" kind="vs">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002024" kind="vs">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002025" kind="vs">For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002026" kind="vs">Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</fragment>
        <fragment id="45002027" kind="vs">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</fragment>

        <fragment id="45003002" kind="vs">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003003" kind="vs">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003004" kind="vs">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</fragment>

        <fragment id="45003007" kind="vs">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003008" kind="vs">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003009" kind="vs">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003010" kind="vs">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003011" kind="vs">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003012" kind="vs">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003013" kind="vs">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003014" kind="vs">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003015" kind="vs">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003016" kind="vs">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003017" kind="vs">And the way of peace have they not known:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003018" kind="vs">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003019" kind="vs">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003020" kind="vs">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003021" kind="vs">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003022" kind="vs">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003023" kind="vs">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003024" kind="vs">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003025" kind="vs">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003026" kind="vs">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003027" kind="vs">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003028" kind="vs">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003029" kind="vs">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45003030" kind="vs">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</fragment>

        <fragment id="45004001" kind="vs">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004002" kind="vs">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004003" kind="vs">For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004004" kind="vs">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004005" kind="vs">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004006" kind="vs">Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004007" kind="vs">Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004008" kind="vs">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004009" kind="vs">Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004010" kind="vs">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004011" kind="vs">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004012" kind="vs">And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004013" kind="vs">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004014" kind="vs">For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004015" kind="vs">Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004016" kind="vs">Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004017" kind="vs">As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004018" kind="vs">Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004019" kind="vs">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004020" kind="vs">He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004021" kind="vs">And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45004022" kind="vs">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</fragment>

        <fragment id="45004024" kind="vs">But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</fragment>

        <fragment id="45005012" kind="vs">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005013" kind="vs">For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005014" kind="vs">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005015" kind="vs">But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005016" kind="vs">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005017" kind="vs">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005018" kind="vs">Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005019" kind="vs">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</fragment>
        <fragment id="45005020" kind="vs">Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</fragment>
