    <frag id="14001001" type="vs">And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</frag>
    <frag id="14001002" type="vs">Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</frag>
    <frag id="14001003" type="vs">So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</frag>
    <frag id="14001004" type="vs">But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14001005" type="vs">Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</frag>
    <frag id="14001006" type="vs">And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</frag>
    <frag id="14001007" type="vs">In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</frag>
    <frag id="14001008" type="vs">And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</frag>
    <frag id="14001009" type="vs">Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</frag>
    <frag id="14001010" type="vs">Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</frag>
    <frag id="14001011" type="vs">And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</frag>
    <frag id="14001012" type="vs">Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</frag>
    <frag id="14001013" type="vs">Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14001014" type="vs">And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14001015" type="vs">And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</frag>
    <frag id="14001016" type="vs">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</frag>
    <frag id="14001017" type="vs">And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="14002">
    <frag id="14002001" type="vs">And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</frag>
    <frag id="14002002" type="vs">And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</frag>
    <frag id="14002003" type="vs">And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</frag>
    <frag id="14002004" type="vs">Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14002005" type="vs">And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.</frag>
    <frag id="14002006" type="vs">But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</frag>
    <frag id="14002007" type="vs">Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</frag>
    <frag id="14002008" type="vs">Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</frag>
    <frag id="14002009" type="vs">Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</frag>
    <frag id="14002010" type="vs">And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</frag>
    <frag id="14002011" type="vs">Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</frag>
    <frag id="14002012" type="vs">Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</frag>
    <frag id="14002013" type="vs">And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</frag>
    <frag id="14002014" type="vs">The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</frag>
    <frag id="14002015" type="vs">Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</frag>
    <frag id="14002016" type="vs">And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14002017" type="vs">And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</frag>
    <frag id="14002018" type="vs">And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="14003">
    <frag id="14003001" type="vs">Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</frag>
    <frag id="14003002" type="vs">And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</frag>
    <frag id="14003003" type="vs">Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</frag>
    <frag id="14003004" type="vs">And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</frag>
    <frag id="14003005" type="vs">And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</frag>
    <frag id="14003006" type="vs">And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</frag>
    <frag id="14003007" type="vs">He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</frag>
    <frag id="14003008" type="vs">And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</frag>
    <frag id="14003009" type="vs">And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</frag>
    <frag id="14003010" type="vs">And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</frag>
    <frag id="14003011" type="vs">And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</frag>
    <frag id="14003012" type="vs">And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</frag>
    <frag id="14003013" type="vs">The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.</frag>
    <frag id="14003014" type="vs">And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</frag>
    <frag id="14003015" type="vs">Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</frag>
    <frag id="14003016" type="vs">And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</frag>
    <frag id="14003017" type="vs">And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="14004">
    <frag id="14004001" type="vs">Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</frag>
    <frag id="14004002" type="vs">Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</frag>
    <frag id="14004003" type="vs">And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.</frag>
    <frag id="14004004" type="vs">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</frag>
    <frag id="14004005" type="vs">And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.</frag>
    <frag id="14004006" type="vs">He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</frag>
    <frag id="14004007" type="vs">And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</frag>
    <frag id="14004008" type="vs">He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.</frag>
    <frag id="14004009" type="vs">Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</frag>
    <frag id="14004010" type="vs">And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</frag>
    <frag id="14004011" type="vs">And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;</frag>
    <frag id="14004012" type="vs">To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;</frag>
    <frag id="14004013" type="vs">And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.</frag>
    <frag id="14004014" type="vs">He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;</frag>
    <frag id="14004015" type="vs">One sea, and twelve oxen under it.</frag>
    <frag id="14004016" type="vs">The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.</frag>
    <frag id="14004017" type="vs">In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</frag>
    <frag id="14004018" type="vs">Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.</frag>
    <frag id="14004019" type="vs">And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;</frag>
    <frag id="14004020" type="vs">Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;</frag>
    <frag id="14004021" type="vs">And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;</frag>
    <frag id="14004022" type="vs">And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="14005">
    <frag id="14005001" type="vs">Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.</frag>
    <frag id="14005002" type="vs">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</frag>
    <frag id="14005003" type="vs">Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.</frag>
    <frag id="14005004" type="vs">And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.</frag>
    <frag id="14005005" type="vs">And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</frag>
    <frag id="14005006" type="vs">Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</frag>
    <frag id="14005007" type="vs">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:</frag>
    <frag id="14005008" type="vs">For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</frag>
    <frag id="14005009" type="vs">And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.</frag>
    <frag id="14005010" type="vs">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</frag>
    <frag id="14005011" type="vs">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:</frag>
    <frag id="14005012" type="vs">Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)</frag>
    <frag id="14005013" type="vs">It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;</frag>
    <frag id="14005014" type="vs">So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="14006">
    <frag id="14006001" type="vs">Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</frag>
    <frag id="14006002" type="vs">But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="14006003" type="vs">And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.</frag>
    <frag id="14006004" type="vs">And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,</frag>

    <frag id="14006007" type="vs">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14006008" type="vs">But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:</frag>

    <frag id="14007002" type="vs">And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.</frag>
    <frag id="14007003" type="vs">And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="14007004" type="vs">Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14007005" type="vs">And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</frag>
    <frag id="14007006" type="vs">And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</frag>
    <frag id="14007007" type="vs">Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.</frag>
    <frag id="14007008" type="vs">Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.</frag>

    <frag id="14010011" type="vs">For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</frag>

    <frag id="14012009" type="vs">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</frag>
    <frag id="14012010" type="vs">Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.</frag>

    <frag id="14013006" type="vs">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.</frag>
    <frag id="14013007" type="vs">And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</frag>
    <frag id="14013008" type="vs">And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.</frag>
    <frag id="14013009" type="vs">Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.</frag>
    <frag id="14013010" type="vs">But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:</frag>
    <frag id="14013011" type="vs">And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.</frag>
    <frag id="14013012" type="vs">And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</frag>
    <frag id="14013013" type="vs">But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</frag>
    <frag id="14013014" type="vs">And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</frag>
    <frag id="14013015" type="vs">Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</frag>

    <frag id="14013017" type="vs">And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</frag>
    <frag id="14013018" type="vs">Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</frag>
    <frag id="14013019" type="vs">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.</frag>

    <frag id="14014002" type="vs">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</frag>
    <frag id="14014003" type="vs">For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</frag>
    <frag id="14014004" type="vs">And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</frag>
    <frag id="14014005" type="vs">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</frag>
    <frag id="14014006" type="vs">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</frag>
    <frag id="14014007" type="vs">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</frag>
    <frag id="14014008" type="vs">And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</frag>
    <frag id="14014009" type="vs">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</frag>
    <frag id="14014010" type="vs">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</frag>
    <frag id="14014011" type="vs">And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</frag>
    <frag id="14014012" type="vs">So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</frag>
    <frag id="14014013" type="vs">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</frag>
    <frag id="14014014" type="vs">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</frag>

    <frag id="14015003" type="vs">Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</frag>
    <frag id="14015004" type="vs">But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</frag>

    <frag id="14015006" type="vs">And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.</frag>
    <frag id="14015007" type="vs">Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</frag>
    <frag id="14015008" type="vs">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14015009" type="vs">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</frag>

    <frag id="14015015" type="vs">And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</frag>

    <frag id="14016002" type="vs">Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</frag>

    <frag id="14016004" type="vs">And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</frag>

    <frag id="14016006" type="vs">Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</frag>

    <frag id="14025004" type="vs">But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</frag>
    <frag id="14025005" type="vs">Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</frag>
    <frag id="14025006" type="vs">He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</frag>
    <frag id="14025007" type="vs">But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.</frag>
    <frag id="14025008" type="vs">But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</frag>
    <frag id="14025009" type="vs">And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</frag>
    <frag id="14025010" type="vs">Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</frag>
    <frag id="14025011" type="vs">And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</frag>
    <frag id="14025012" type="vs">And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</frag>
    <frag id="14025013" type="vs">But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</frag>
    <frag id="14025014" type="vs">Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</frag>
    <frag id="14025015" type="vs">Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</frag>
    <frag id="14025016" type="vs">And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</frag>
    <frag id="14025017" type="vs">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</frag>
    <frag id="14025018" type="vs">And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</frag>
    <frag id="14025019" type="vs">Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</frag>
    <frag id="14025020" type="vs">But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</frag>
    <frag id="14025021" type="vs">So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</frag>

    <frag id="14030005" type="vs">So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.</frag>
    <frag id="14030006" type="vs">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</frag>
    <frag id="14030007" type="vs">And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</frag>
    <frag id="14030008" type="vs">Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</frag>
    <frag id="14030009" type="vs">For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="14030010" type="vs">So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</frag>
    <frag id="14030011" type="vs">Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14030012" type="vs">Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14030013" type="vs">And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</frag>
    <frag id="14030014" type="vs">And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</frag>
    <frag id="14030015" type="vs">Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14030016" type="vs">And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.</frag>
    <frag id="14030017" type="vs">For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14030018" type="vs">For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</frag>
    <frag id="14030019" type="vs">That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</frag>
    <frag id="14030020" type="vs">And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</frag>
    <frag id="14030021" type="vs">And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14030022" type="vs">And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</frag>
    <frag id="14030023" type="vs">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</frag>
    <frag id="14030024" type="vs">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</frag>
    <frag id="14030025" type="vs">And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</frag>
    <frag id="14030026" type="vs">So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14030027" type="vs">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="14031">
    <frag id="14031001" type="vs">Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</frag>
    <frag id="14031002" type="vs">And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14031003" type="vs">He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14031004" type="vs">Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14031005" type="vs">And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.</frag>
    <frag id="14031006" type="vs">And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.</frag>
    <frag id="14031007" type="vs">In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.</frag>
    <frag id="14031008" type="vs">And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</frag>

    <frag id="14031011" type="vs">Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,</frag>

    <frag id="14031014" type="vs">And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.</frag>

    <frag id="14032002" type="vs">And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</frag>
    <frag id="14032003" type="vs">He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.</frag>
    <frag id="14032004" type="vs">So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</frag>
    <frag id="14032005" type="vs">Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</frag>
    <frag id="14032006" type="vs">And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="14032007" type="vs">Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:</frag>
    <frag id="14032008" type="vs">With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</frag>
    <frag id="14032009" type="vs">After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="14032010" type="vs">Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</frag>
    <frag id="14032011" type="vs">Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</frag>
    <frag id="14032012" type="vs">Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</frag>
    <frag id="14032013" type="vs">Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</frag>

    <frag id="14032015" type="vs">Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</frag>
    <frag id="14032016" type="vs">And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</frag>
    <frag id="14032017" type="vs">He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</frag>
    <frag id="14032018" type="vs">Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</frag>
    <frag id="14032019" type="vs">And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</frag>

    <frag id="14032021" type="vs">And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria.

    <frag id="14032022" type="vs">Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</frag>
    <frag id="14032023" type="vs">And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</frag>

    <frag id="14032025" type="vs">But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14032026" type="vs">Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</frag>
    <frag id="14032027" type="vs">And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</frag>
    <frag id="14032028" type="vs">Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</frag>
    <frag id="14032029" type="vs">Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</frag>
    <frag id="14032030" type="vs">This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</frag>
    <frag id="14032031" type="vs">Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</frag>
    <frag id="14032032" type="vs">Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14032033" type="vs">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="14033">
    <frag id="14033001" type="vs">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:</frag>
    <frag id="14033002" type="vs">But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14033003" type="vs">For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</frag>
    <frag id="14033004" type="vs">Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="14033005" type="vs">And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14033006" type="vs">And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</frag>
    <frag id="14033007" type="vs">And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</frag>
    <frag id="14033008" type="vs">Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</frag>
    <frag id="14033009" type="vs">So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14033010" type="vs">And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.</frag>
    <frag id="14033011" type="vs">Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="14033012" type="vs">And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</frag>
    <frag id="14033013" type="vs">And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.</frag>
    <frag id="14033014" type="vs">Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</frag>
    <frag id="14033015" type="vs">And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</frag>
    <frag id="14033016" type="vs">And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14033017" type="vs">Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.</frag>
    <frag id="14033018" type="vs">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</frag>

    <frag id="14034022" type="vs">And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</frag>
    <frag id="14034023" type="vs">And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</frag>
    <frag id="14034024" type="vs">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</frag>
    <frag id="14034025" type="vs">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</frag>
    <frag id="14034026" type="vs">And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</frag>
    <frag id="14034027" type="vs">Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14034028" type="vs">Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</frag>
    <frag id="14034029" type="vs">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14034030" type="vs">And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14034031" type="vs">And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</frag>
    <frag id="14034032" type="vs">And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</frag>
    <frag id="14034033" type="vs">And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="14035">
    <frag id="14035001" type="vs">Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</frag>
    <frag id="14035002" type="vs">And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</frag>
    <frag id="14035003" type="vs">And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</frag>
    <frag id="14035004" type="vs">And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</frag>
    <frag id="14035005" type="vs">And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.</frag>
    <frag id="14035006" type="vs">So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</frag>
    <frag id="14035007" type="vs">And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.</frag>
    <frag id="14035008" type="vs">And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</frag>
    <frag id="14035009" type="vs">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</frag>
    <frag id="14035010" type="vs">So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</frag>
    <frag id="14035011" type="vs">And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</frag>
    <frag id="14035012" type="vs">And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</frag>
    <frag id="14035013" type="vs">And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</frag>
    <frag id="14035014" type="vs">And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</frag>
    <frag id="14035015" type="vs">And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</frag>
    <frag id="14035016" type="vs">So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</frag>
    <frag id="14035017" type="vs">And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</frag>
    <frag id="14035018" type="vs">And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14035019" type="vs">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</frag>
    <frag id="14035020" type="vs">After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</frag>
    <frag id="14035021" type="vs">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</frag>
    <frag id="14035022" type="vs">Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</frag>
    <frag id="14035023" type="vs">And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</frag>
    <frag id="14035024" type="vs">His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</frag>
    <frag id="14035025" type="vs">And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</frag>
    <frag id="14035026" type="vs">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</frag>
    <frag id="14035027" type="vs">And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</frag>

    <frag id="14036001" type="vs">Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14036002" type="vs">Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14036003" type="vs">And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</frag>
    <frag id="14036004" type="vs">And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</frag>
    <frag id="14036005" type="vs">Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</frag>
    <frag id="14036006" type="vs">Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="14036007" type="vs">Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="14036008" type="vs">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</frag>
    <frag id="14036009" type="vs">Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14036010" type="vs">And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14036011" type="vs">Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14036012" type="vs">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="14036013" type="vs">And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="14036014" type="vs">Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="14036015" type="vs">And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:</frag>
    <frag id="14036016" type="vs">But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.</frag>
    <frag id="14036017" type="vs">Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.</frag>
    <frag id="14036018" type="vs">And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.</frag>

    <frag id="14036022" type="vs">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="14036023" type="vs">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
