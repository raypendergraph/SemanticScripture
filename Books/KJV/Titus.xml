        <fragment id="56001003" kind="vs">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001004" kind="vs">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001005" kind="vs">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001006" kind="vs">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001007" kind="vs">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001008" kind="vs">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001009" kind="vs">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001010" kind="vs">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001011" kind="vs">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001012" kind="vs">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001013" kind="vs">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001014" kind="vs">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001015" kind="vs">Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56001016" kind="vs">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</fragment>

        <fragment id="56002003" kind="vs">The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</fragment>
        <fragment id="56002004" kind="vs">That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</fragment>
        <fragment id="56002005" kind="vs">To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56002006" kind="vs">Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56002007" kind="vs">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</fragment>
        <fragment id="56002008" kind="vs">Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</fragment>

        <fragment id="56002013" kind="vs">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</fragment>
        <fragment id="56002014" kind="vs">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56002015" kind="vs">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</fragment>

        <fragment id="56003002" kind="vs">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56003003" kind="vs">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56003004" kind="vs">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</fragment>
        <fragment id="56003005" kind="vs">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</fragment>

        <fragment id="56003007" kind="vs">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56003008" kind="vs">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56003009" kind="vs">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</fragment>
        <fragment id="56003010" kind="vs">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</fragment>
        <fragment id="56003011" kind="vs">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</fragment>

        <fragment id="56003014" kind="vs">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</fragment>
