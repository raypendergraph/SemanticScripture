    <chapter n="1">
      <CAPTION vref="1">It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.</CAPTION>
      <verse n="1" id="titus.1.1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</verse>
      <verse n="2" id="titus.1.2">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</verse>
      <verse n="3" id="titus.1.3">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</verse>
      <verse n="4" id="titus.1.4">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</verse>
      <verse n="5" id="titus.1.5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</verse>
      <verse n="6" id="titus.1.6">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</verse>
      <verse n="7" id="titus.1.7">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</verse>
      <verse n="8" id="titus.1.8">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
      <verse n="9" id="titus.1.9">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
      <verse n="10" id="titus.1.10">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</verse>
      <verse n="11" id="titus.1.11">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</verse>
      <verse n="12" id="titus.1.12">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</verse>
      <verse n="13" id="titus.1.13">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
      <verse n="14" id="titus.1.14">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</verse>
      <verse n="15" id="titus.1.15">Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</verse>
      <verse n="16" id="titus.1.16">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</verse>
    </chapter>
    <chapter n="2">
      <verse n="1" id="titus.2.1">But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</verse>

      <verse n="3" id="titus.2.3">The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</verse>

      <verse n="6" id="titus.2.6">Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</verse>
      <verse n="7" id="titus.2.7">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</verse>
      <verse n="8" id="titus.2.8">Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</verse>
      <verse n="9" id="titus.2.9">Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</verse>
      <verse n="10" id="titus.2.10">Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
      <verse n="11" id="titus.2.11">For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</verse>
      <verse n="12" id="titus.2.12">Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</verse>
      <verse n="13" id="titus.2.13">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
      <verse n="14" id="titus.2.14">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</verse>
      <verse n="15" id="titus.2.15">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</verse>

    <chapter n="3">
      <verse n="1" id="titus.3.1">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</verse>
      <verse n="2" id="titus.3.2">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</verse>
      <verse n="3" id="titus.3.3">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
      <verse n="4" id="titus.3.4">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</verse>
      <verse n="5" id="titus.3.5">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</verse>
      <verse n="6" id="titus.3.6">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
      <verse n="7" id="titus.3.7">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
      <verse n="8" id="titus.3.8">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</verse>
      <verse n="9" id="titus.3.9">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
      <verse n="10" id="titus.3.10">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</verse>
      <verse n="11" id="titus.3.11">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</verse>
      <verse n="12" id="titus.3.12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</verse>
      <verse n="13" id="titus.3.13">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</verse>
      <verse n="14" id="titus.3.14">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
      <verse n="15" id="titus.3.15">All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. </verse>
