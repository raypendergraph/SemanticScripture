    <frag id="33001002" type="vs">Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</frag>
    <frag id="33001003" type="vs">For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</frag>
    <frag id="33001004" type="vs">And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.</frag>
    <frag id="33001005" type="vs">For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?</frag>
    <frag id="33001006" type="vs">Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</frag>
    <frag id="33001007" type="vs">And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</frag>
    <frag id="33001008" type="vs">Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</frag>
    <frag id="33001009" type="vs">For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="33001010" type="vs">Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</frag>
    <frag id="33001011" type="vs">Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</frag>
    <frag id="33001012" type="vs">For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="33001013" type="vs">O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</frag>
    <frag id="33001014" type="vs">Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="33001015" type="vs">Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="33001016" type="vs">Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</frag>

    <frag id="33002002" type="vs">And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</frag>
    <frag id="33002003" type="vs">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.</frag>
    <frag id="33002004" type="vs">In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</frag>
    <frag id="33002005" type="vs">Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="33002006" type="vs">Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.</frag>

    <frag id="33002008" type="vs">Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</frag>
    <frag id="33002009" type="vs">The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</frag>

    <frag id="33002012" type="vs">I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.</frag>
    <frag id="33002013" type="vs">The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</frag>

    <frag id="33003004" type="vs">Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</frag>
    <frag id="33003005" type="vs">Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</frag>
    <frag id="33003006" type="vs">Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</frag>
    <frag id="33003007" type="vs">Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.</frag>
    <frag id="33003008" type="vs">But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</frag>
    <frag id="33003009" type="vs">Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</frag>
    <frag id="33003010" type="vs">They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</frag>

    <frag id="33004002" type="vs">And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="33004003" type="vs">And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</frag>
    <frag id="33004004" type="vs">But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.</frag>

    <frag id="33004009" type="vs">Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</frag>
    <frag id="33004010" type="vs">Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</frag>
