      <CAPTION vref="1">Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.</CAPTION>
      <block id="57001001" type="v">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</block>
      <block id="57001002" type="v">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</block>
      <block id="57001003" type="v">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</block>
      <block id="57001004" type="v">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</block>
      <block id="57001005" type="v">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</block>
      <block id="57001006" type="v">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</block>
      <block id="57001007" type="v">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</block>
      <block id="57001008" type="v">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</block>
      <block id="57001009" type="v">Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</block>
      <block id="57001010" type="v">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</block>
      <block id="57001011" type="v">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</block>
      <block id="57001012" type="v">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</block>
      <block id="57001013" type="v">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</block>
      <block id="57001014" type="v">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</block>
      <block id="57001015" type="v">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</block>
      <block id="57001016" type="v">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</block>
      <block id="57001017" type="v">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</block>
      <block id="57001018" type="v">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</block>
      <block id="57001019" type="v">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</block>
      <block id="57001020" type="v">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</block>
      <block id="57001021" type="v">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</block>
      <block id="57001022" type="v">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</block>
      <block id="57001023" type="v">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</block>
      <block id="57001024" type="v">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</block>
      <block id="57001025" type="v">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </block>
