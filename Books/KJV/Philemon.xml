    <chapter n="1">
      <CAPTION vref="1">Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.</CAPTION>
      <verse n="1" id="phlm.1.1">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</verse>
      <verse n="2" id="phlm.1.2">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</verse>
      <verse n="3" id="phlm.1.3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse n="4" id="phlm.1.4">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</verse>
      <verse n="5" id="phlm.1.5">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
      <verse n="6" id="phlm.1.6">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
      <verse n="7" id="phlm.1.7">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
      <verse n="8" id="phlm.1.8">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</verse>
      <verse n="9" id="phlm.1.9">Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse n="10" id="phlm.1.10">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
      <verse n="11" id="phlm.1.11">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</verse>
      <verse n="12" id="phlm.1.12">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</verse>
      <verse n="13" id="phlm.1.13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
      <verse n="14" id="phlm.1.14">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
      <verse n="15" id="phlm.1.15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</verse>
      <verse n="16" id="phlm.1.16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
      <verse n="17" id="phlm.1.17">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
      <verse n="18" id="phlm.1.18">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</verse>
      <verse n="19" id="phlm.1.19">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</verse>
      <verse n="20" id="phlm.1.20">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
      <verse n="21" id="phlm.1.21">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</verse>
      <verse n="22" id="phlm.1.22">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
      <verse n="23" id="phlm.1.23">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
      <verse n="24" id="phlm.1.24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</verse>
      <verse n="25" id="phlm.1.25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </verse>
