          <ab id="15001001" type="verse">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="15001002" type="verse">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</ab>
          <ab id="15001003" type="verse">Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="15001004" type="verse">And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="15001005" type="verse">Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="15001006" type="verse">And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.</ab>
          <ab id="15001007" type="verse">Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</ab>
          <ab id="15001008" type="verse">Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</ab>
          <ab id="15001009" type="verse">And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,</ab>
          <ab id="15001010" type="verse">Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.</ab>

          <ab id="15003012" type="verse">But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</ab>
          <ab id="15003013" type="verse">So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</ab>

          <ab id="15004003" type="verse">But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</ab>
          <ab id="15004004" type="verse">Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</ab>
          <ab id="15004005" type="verse">And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</ab>
          <ab id="15004006" type="verse">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</ab>

          <ab id="15004014" type="verse">Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</ab>
          <ab id="15004015" type="verse">That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</ab>
          <ab id="15004016" type="verse">We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</ab>
          <ab id="15004017" type="verse">Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</ab>
