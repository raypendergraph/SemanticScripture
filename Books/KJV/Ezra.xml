    <frag id="15001002" type="vs">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</frag>
    <frag id="15001003" type="vs">Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="15001004" type="vs">And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="15001005" type="vs">Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="15001006" type="vs">And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.</frag>
    <frag id="15001007" type="vs">Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</frag>
    <frag id="15001008" type="vs">Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</frag>
    <frag id="15001009" type="vs">And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="15003">
    <frag id="15003001" type="vs">And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="15003002" type="vs">Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</frag>
    <frag id="15003003" type="vs">And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.</frag>
    <frag id="15003004" type="vs">They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;</frag>
    <frag id="15003005" type="vs">And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="15003006" type="vs">From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</frag>
    <frag id="15003007" type="vs">They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</frag>
    <frag id="15003008" type="vs">Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="15003009" type="vs">Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</frag>
    <frag id="15003010" type="vs">And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="15003011" type="vs">And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</frag>
    <frag id="15003012" type="vs">But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</frag>
    <frag id="15003013" type="vs">So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="15004">
    <frag id="15004001" type="vs">Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;</frag>
    <frag id="15004002" type="vs">Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</frag>
    <frag id="15004003" type="vs">But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</frag>
    <frag id="15004004" type="vs">Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</frag>
    <frag id="15004005" type="vs">And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</frag>
    <frag id="15004006" type="vs">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="15004007" type="vs">And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</frag>
    <frag id="15004008" type="vs">Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</frag>
    <frag id="15004009" type="vs">Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</frag>
    <frag id="15004010" type="vs">And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.</frag>
    <frag id="15004011" type="vs">This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.</frag>
    <frag id="15004012" type="vs">Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.</frag>
    <frag id="15004013" type="vs">Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</frag>
    <frag id="15004014" type="vs">Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</frag>
    <frag id="15004015" type="vs">That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</frag>
    <frag id="15004016" type="vs">We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</frag>
    <frag id="15004017" type="vs">Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</frag>
    <frag id="15004018" type="vs">The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</frag>
    <frag id="15004019" type="vs">And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</frag>
    <frag id="15004020" type="vs">There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</frag>
    <frag id="15004021" type="vs">Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.</frag>
    <frag id="15004022" type="vs">Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</frag>
    <frag id="15004023" type="vs">Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</frag>
    <frag id="15004024" type="vs">Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="15005">
    <frag id="15005001" type="vs">Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.</frag>
    <frag id="15005002" type="vs">Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.</frag>
    <frag id="15005003" type="vs">At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</frag>
    <frag id="15005004" type="vs">Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?</frag>
    <frag id="15005005" type="vs">But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.</frag>
    <frag id="15005006" type="vs">The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:</frag>

    <frag id="15005009" type="vs">Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?</frag>
    <frag id="15005010" type="vs">We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</frag>
    <frag id="15005011" type="vs">And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.</frag>
    <frag id="15005012" type="vs">But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="15005013" type="vs">But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</frag>
    <frag id="15005014" type="vs">And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;</frag>

    <frag id="15005017" type="vs">Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="15006">
    <frag id="15006001" type="vs">Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</frag>

    <frag id="15006003" type="vs">In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;</frag>
    <frag id="15006004" type="vs">With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:</frag>

    <frag id="15006006" type="vs">Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:</frag>

    <frag id="15008022" type="vs">For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</frag>
    <frag id="15008023" type="vs">So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.</frag>
    <frag id="15008024" type="vs">Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</frag>
