        <fragment id="43001001" kind="vs">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001002" kind="vs">The same was in the beginning with God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001003" kind="vs">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001004" kind="vs">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001005" kind="vs">And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001006" kind="vs">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001007" kind="vs">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001008" kind="vs">He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001009" kind="vs">That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001010" kind="vs">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001011" kind="vs">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001012" kind="vs">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001013" kind="vs">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001014" kind="vs">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001015" kind="vs">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001016" kind="vs">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001017" kind="vs">For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001018" kind="vs">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001019" kind="vs">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001020" kind="vs">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001021" kind="vs">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001022" kind="vs">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001023" kind="vs">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001024" kind="vs">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001025" kind="vs">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001026" kind="vs">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001027" kind="vs">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001028" kind="vs">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001029" kind="vs">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001030" kind="vs">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001031" kind="vs">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001032" kind="vs">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001033" kind="vs">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001034" kind="vs">And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001035" kind="vs">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001036" kind="vs">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001037" kind="vs">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001038" kind="vs">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001039" kind="vs">He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001040" kind="vs">One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001041" kind="vs">He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001042" kind="vs">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001043" kind="vs">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001044" kind="vs">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001045" kind="vs">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001046" kind="vs">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001047" kind="vs">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001048" kind="vs">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001049" kind="vs">Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001050" kind="vs">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43001051" kind="vs">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</fragment>

        <fragment id="43002001" kind="vs">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002002" kind="vs">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002003" kind="vs">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002004" kind="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002005" kind="vs">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002006" kind="vs">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002007" kind="vs">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002008" kind="vs">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002009" kind="vs">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002010" kind="vs">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002011" kind="vs">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002012" kind="vs">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002013" kind="vs">And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002014" kind="vs">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002015" kind="vs">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002016" kind="vs">And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002017" kind="vs">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002018" kind="vs">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002019" kind="vs">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002020" kind="vs">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002021" kind="vs">But he spake of the temple of his body.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002022" kind="vs">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002023" kind="vs">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002024" kind="vs">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</fragment>
        <fragment id="43002025" kind="vs">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</fragment>

        <fragment id="43003001" kind="vs">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003002" kind="vs">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003003" kind="vs">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003004" kind="vs">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003005" kind="vs">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003006" kind="vs">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003007" kind="vs">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003008" kind="vs">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003009" kind="vs">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003010" kind="vs">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003011" kind="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003012" kind="vs">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003013" kind="vs">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003014" kind="vs">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003015" kind="vs">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003016" kind="vs">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003017" kind="vs">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003018" kind="vs">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003019" kind="vs">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003020" kind="vs">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003021" kind="vs">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003022" kind="vs">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003023" kind="vs">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003024" kind="vs">For John was not yet cast into prison.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003025" kind="vs">Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003026" kind="vs">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003027" kind="vs">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003028" kind="vs">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003029" kind="vs">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003030" kind="vs">He must increase, but I must decrease.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003031" kind="vs">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003032" kind="vs">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003033" kind="vs">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003034" kind="vs">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003035" kind="vs">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43003036" kind="vs">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</fragment>

        <fragment id="43006004" kind="vs">And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</fragment>
        <fragment id="43006005" kind="vs">When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</fragment>

        <fragment id="43006007" kind="vs">Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</fragment>

        <fragment id="43006011" kind="vs">And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</fragment>

        <fragment id="43006013" kind="vs">Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</fragment>

        <fragment id="43011054" kind="vs">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</fragment>
