    <frag id="43001001" type="vs">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</frag>
    <frag id="43001002" type="vs">The same was in the beginning with God.</frag>
    <frag id="43001003" type="vs">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</frag>
    <frag id="43001004" type="vs">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</frag>
    <frag id="43001005" type="vs">And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</frag>
    <frag id="43001006" type="vs">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</frag>
    <frag id="43001007" type="vs">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</frag>
    <frag id="43001008" type="vs">He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</frag>
    <frag id="43001009" type="vs">That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43001010" type="vs">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</frag>
    <frag id="43001011" type="vs">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</frag>
    <frag id="43001012" type="vs">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</frag>
    <frag id="43001013" type="vs">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</frag>
    <frag id="43001014" type="vs">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</frag>
    <frag id="43001015" type="vs">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</frag>
    <frag id="43001016" type="vs">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</frag>
    <frag id="43001017" type="vs">For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</frag>
    <frag id="43001018" type="vs">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</frag>
    <frag id="43001019" type="vs">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</frag>
    <frag id="43001020" type="vs">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</frag>
    <frag id="43001021" type="vs">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</frag>
    <frag id="43001022" type="vs">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</frag>
    <frag id="43001023" type="vs">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</frag>
    <frag id="43001024" type="vs">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</frag>
    <frag id="43001025" type="vs">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</frag>
    <frag id="43001026" type="vs">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</frag>
    <frag id="43001027" type="vs">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</frag>
    <frag id="43001028" type="vs">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</frag>
    <frag id="43001029" type="vs">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43001030" type="vs">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</frag>
    <frag id="43001031" type="vs">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</frag>
    <frag id="43001032" type="vs">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</frag>
    <frag id="43001033" type="vs">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</frag>
    <frag id="43001034" type="vs">And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</frag>
    <frag id="43001035" type="vs">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</frag>
    <frag id="43001036" type="vs">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</frag>
    <frag id="43001037" type="vs">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43001038" type="vs">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</frag>
    <frag id="43001039" type="vs">He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</frag>
    <frag id="43001040" type="vs">One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</frag>
    <frag id="43001041" type="vs">He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</frag>
    <frag id="43001042" type="vs">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</frag>
    <frag id="43001043" type="vs">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</frag>
    <frag id="43001044" type="vs">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</frag>
    <frag id="43001045" type="vs">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</frag>
    <frag id="43001046" type="vs">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</frag>
    <frag id="43001047" type="vs">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</frag>
    <frag id="43001048" type="vs">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</frag>
    <frag id="43001049" type="vs">Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="43001050" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</frag>
    <frag id="43001051" type="vs">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="43002">
    <frag id="43002001" type="vs">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</frag>
    <frag id="43002002" type="vs">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</frag>
    <frag id="43002003" type="vs">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</frag>
    <frag id="43002004" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</frag>
    <frag id="43002005" type="vs">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</frag>
    <frag id="43002006" type="vs">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</frag>
    <frag id="43002007" type="vs">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</frag>
    <frag id="43002008" type="vs">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</frag>
    <frag id="43002009" type="vs">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</frag>
    <frag id="43002010" type="vs">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</frag>
    <frag id="43002011" type="vs">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</frag>
    <frag id="43002012" type="vs">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</frag>
    <frag id="43002013" type="vs">And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</frag>
    <frag id="43002014" type="vs">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</frag>
    <frag id="43002015" type="vs">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</frag>
    <frag id="43002016" type="vs">And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</frag>
    <frag id="43002017" type="vs">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</frag>
    <frag id="43002018" type="vs">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</frag>
    <frag id="43002019" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</frag>
    <frag id="43002020" type="vs">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</frag>
    <frag id="43002021" type="vs">But he spake of the temple of his body.</frag>
    <frag id="43002022" type="vs">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</frag>
    <frag id="43002023" type="vs">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</frag>
    <frag id="43002024" type="vs">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</frag>
    <frag id="43002025" type="vs">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43003">
    <frag id="43003001" type="vs">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</frag>
    <frag id="43003002" type="vs">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</frag>
    <frag id="43003003" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</frag>
    <frag id="43003004" type="vs">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</frag>
    <frag id="43003005" type="vs">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</frag>
    <frag id="43003006" type="vs">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</frag>
    <frag id="43003007" type="vs">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</frag>
    <frag id="43003008" type="vs">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</frag>
    <frag id="43003009" type="vs">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</frag>
    <frag id="43003010" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</frag>
    <frag id="43003011" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</frag>
    <frag id="43003012" type="vs">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</frag>
    <frag id="43003013" type="vs">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</frag>
    <frag id="43003014" type="vs">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</frag>
    <frag id="43003015" type="vs">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</frag>
    <frag id="43003016" type="vs">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</frag>
    <frag id="43003017" type="vs">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</frag>
    <frag id="43003018" type="vs">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</frag>
    <frag id="43003019" type="vs">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</frag>
    <frag id="43003020" type="vs">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</frag>
    <frag id="43003021" type="vs">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</frag>
    <frag id="43003022" type="vs">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</frag>
    <frag id="43003023" type="vs">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</frag>
    <frag id="43003024" type="vs">For John was not yet cast into prison.</frag>
    <frag id="43003025" type="vs">Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</frag>
    <frag id="43003026" type="vs">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</frag>
    <frag id="43003027" type="vs">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</frag>
    <frag id="43003028" type="vs">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</frag>
    <frag id="43003029" type="vs">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</frag>
    <frag id="43003030" type="vs">He must increase, but I must decrease.</frag>
    <frag id="43003031" type="vs">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</frag>
    <frag id="43003032" type="vs">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</frag>
    <frag id="43003033" type="vs">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</frag>
    <frag id="43003034" type="vs">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="43003035" type="vs">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</frag>
    <frag id="43003036" type="vs">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43004">
    <frag id="43004001" type="vs">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</frag>
    <frag id="43004002" type="vs">Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</frag>
    <frag id="43004003" type="vs">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</frag>
    <frag id="43004004" type="vs">And he must needs go through Samaria.</frag>
    <frag id="43004005" type="vs">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</frag>
    <frag id="43004006" type="vs">Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</frag>
    <frag id="43004007" type="vs">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</frag>
    <frag id="43004008" type="vs">For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</frag>
    <frag id="43004009" type="vs">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</frag>
    <frag id="43004010" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</frag>
    <frag id="43004011" type="vs">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</frag>
    <frag id="43004012" type="vs">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</frag>
    <frag id="43004013" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</frag>
    <frag id="43004014" type="vs">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</frag>
    <frag id="43004015" type="vs">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</frag>
    <frag id="43004016" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</frag>
    <frag id="43004017" type="vs">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</frag>
    <frag id="43004018" type="vs">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</frag>
    <frag id="43004019" type="vs">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</frag>
    <frag id="43004020" type="vs">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</frag>
    <frag id="43004021" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</frag>
    <frag id="43004022" type="vs">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</frag>
    <frag id="43004023" type="vs">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</frag>
    <frag id="43004024" type="vs">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</frag>
    <frag id="43004025" type="vs">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</frag>
    <frag id="43004026" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</frag>
    <frag id="43004027" type="vs">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</frag>
    <frag id="43004028" type="vs">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</frag>
    <frag id="43004029" type="vs">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</frag>
    <frag id="43004030" type="vs">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="43004031" type="vs">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</frag>
    <frag id="43004032" type="vs">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</frag>
    <frag id="43004033" type="vs">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</frag>
    <frag id="43004034" type="vs">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</frag>
    <frag id="43004035" type="vs">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</frag>
    <frag id="43004036" type="vs">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</frag>
    <frag id="43004037" type="vs">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</frag>
    <frag id="43004038" type="vs">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</frag>
    <frag id="43004039" type="vs">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</frag>
    <frag id="43004040" type="vs">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</frag>
    <frag id="43004041" type="vs">And many more believed because of his own word;</frag>
    <frag id="43004042" type="vs">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43004043" type="vs">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</frag>
    <frag id="43004044" type="vs">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</frag>
    <frag id="43004045" type="vs">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</frag>
    <frag id="43004046" type="vs">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</frag>
    <frag id="43004047" type="vs">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</frag>
    <frag id="43004048" type="vs">Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</frag>
    <frag id="43004049" type="vs">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</frag>
    <frag id="43004050" type="vs">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</frag>
    <frag id="43004051" type="vs">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</frag>
    <frag id="43004052" type="vs">Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</frag>
    <frag id="43004053" type="vs">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</frag>
    <frag id="43004054" type="vs">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="43005">
    <frag id="43005001" type="vs">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="43005002" type="vs">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</frag>
    <frag id="43005003" type="vs">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</frag>
    <frag id="43005004" type="vs">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</frag>
    <frag id="43005005" type="vs">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</frag>
    <frag id="43005006" type="vs">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</frag>
    <frag id="43005007" type="vs">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</frag>
    <frag id="43005008" type="vs">Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</frag>
    <frag id="43005009" type="vs">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</frag>
    <frag id="43005010" type="vs">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</frag>
    <frag id="43005011" type="vs">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</frag>
    <frag id="43005012" type="vs">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</frag>
    <frag id="43005013" type="vs">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</frag>
    <frag id="43005014" type="vs">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</frag>
    <frag id="43005015" type="vs">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</frag>
    <frag id="43005016" type="vs">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</frag>
    <frag id="43005017" type="vs">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</frag>
    <frag id="43005018" type="vs">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</frag>
    <frag id="43005019" type="vs">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</frag>
    <frag id="43005020" type="vs">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</frag>
    <frag id="43005021" type="vs">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</frag>
    <frag id="43005022" type="vs">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</frag>
    <frag id="43005023" type="vs">That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</frag>
    <frag id="43005024" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</frag>
    <frag id="43005025" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</frag>
    <frag id="43005026" type="vs">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</frag>
    <frag id="43005027" type="vs">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</frag>
    <frag id="43005028" type="vs">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</frag>
    <frag id="43005029" type="vs">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</frag>
    <frag id="43005030" type="vs">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43005031" type="vs">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</frag>
    <frag id="43005032" type="vs">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</frag>
    <frag id="43005033" type="vs">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</frag>
    <frag id="43005034" type="vs">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</frag>
    <frag id="43005035" type="vs">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</frag>
    <frag id="43005036" type="vs">But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43005037" type="vs">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</frag>
    <frag id="43005038" type="vs">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</frag>
    <frag id="43005039" type="vs">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</frag>
    <frag id="43005040" type="vs">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</frag>
    <frag id="43005041" type="vs">I receive not honour from men.</frag>
    <frag id="43005042" type="vs">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</frag>
    <frag id="43005043" type="vs">I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</frag>
    <frag id="43005044" type="vs">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</frag>
    <frag id="43005045" type="vs">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</frag>
    <frag id="43005046" type="vs">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</frag>
    <frag id="43005047" type="vs">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</frag>

    <frag id="43006001" type="vs">After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.</frag>
    <frag id="43006002" type="vs">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</frag>
    <frag id="43006003" type="vs">And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</frag>
    <frag id="43006004" type="vs">And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</frag>
    <frag id="43006005" type="vs">When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</frag>
    <frag id="43006006" type="vs">And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</frag>
    <frag id="43006007" type="vs">Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</frag>
    <frag id="43006008" type="vs">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,</frag>
    <frag id="43006009" type="vs">There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</frag>
    <frag id="43006010" type="vs">And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</frag>
    <frag id="43006011" type="vs">And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</frag>
    <frag id="43006012" type="vs">When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</frag>
    <frag id="43006013" type="vs">Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</frag>
    <frag id="43006014" type="vs">Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43006015" type="vs">When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</frag>
    <frag id="43006016" type="vs">And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</frag>
    <frag id="43006017" type="vs">And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</frag>
    <frag id="43006018" type="vs">And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</frag>
    <frag id="43006019" type="vs">So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</frag>
    <frag id="43006020" type="vs">But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</frag>
    <frag id="43006021" type="vs">Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</frag>
    <frag id="43006022" type="vs">The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;</frag>
    <frag id="43006023" type="vs">Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</frag>
    <frag id="43006024" type="vs">When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43006025" type="vs">And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</frag>
    <frag id="43006026" type="vs">Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</frag>
    <frag id="43006027" type="vs">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</frag>
    <frag id="43006028" type="vs">Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</frag>
    <frag id="43006029" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</frag>
    <frag id="43006030" type="vs">They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</frag>
    <frag id="43006031" type="vs">Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</frag>
    <frag id="43006032" type="vs">Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</frag>
    <frag id="43006033" type="vs">For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43006034" type="vs">Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</frag>
    <frag id="43006035" type="vs">And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</frag>
    <frag id="43006036" type="vs">But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</frag>
    <frag id="43006037" type="vs">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</frag>
    <frag id="43006038" type="vs">For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43006039" type="vs">And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</frag>
    <frag id="43006040" type="vs">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</frag>
    <frag id="43006041" type="vs">The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</frag>
    <frag id="43006042" type="vs">And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</frag>
    <frag id="43006043" type="vs">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</frag>
    <frag id="43006044" type="vs">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</frag>
    <frag id="43006045" type="vs">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</frag>
    <frag id="43006046" type="vs">Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</frag>
    <frag id="43006047" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</frag>
    <frag id="43006048" type="vs">I am that bread of life.</frag>
    <frag id="43006049" type="vs">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</frag>
    <frag id="43006050" type="vs">This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</frag>
    <frag id="43006051" type="vs">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43006052" type="vs">The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</frag>
    <frag id="43006053" type="vs">Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</frag>
    <frag id="43006054" type="vs">Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</frag>
    <frag id="43006055" type="vs">For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</frag>
    <frag id="43006056" type="vs">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</frag>
    <frag id="43006057" type="vs">As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</frag>
    <frag id="43006058" type="vs">This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="43006059" type="vs">These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</frag>
    <frag id="43006060" type="vs">Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</frag>
    <frag id="43006061" type="vs">When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?</frag>
    <frag id="43006062" type="vs">What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</frag>
    <frag id="43006063" type="vs">It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</frag>
    <frag id="43006064" type="vs">But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</frag>
    <frag id="43006065" type="vs">And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</frag>
    <frag id="43006066" type="vs">From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</frag>
    <frag id="43006067" type="vs">Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</frag>
    <frag id="43006068" type="vs">Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</frag>
    <frag id="43006069" type="vs">And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</frag>
    <frag id="43006070" type="vs">Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</frag>
    <frag id="43006071" type="vs">He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43007">
    <frag id="43007001" type="vs">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</frag>
    <frag id="43007002" type="vs">Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</frag>
    <frag id="43007003" type="vs">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</frag>
    <frag id="43007004" type="vs">For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43007005" type="vs">For neither did his brethren believe in him.</frag>
    <frag id="43007006" type="vs">Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</frag>
    <frag id="43007007" type="vs">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</frag>
    <frag id="43007008" type="vs">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</frag>
    <frag id="43007009" type="vs">When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</frag>
    <frag id="43007010" type="vs">But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</frag>
    <frag id="43007011" type="vs">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</frag>
    <frag id="43007012" type="vs">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</frag>
    <frag id="43007013" type="vs">Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</frag>
    <frag id="43007014" type="vs">Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</frag>
    <frag id="43007015" type="vs">And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</frag>
    <frag id="43007016" type="vs">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43007017" type="vs">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</frag>
    <frag id="43007018" type="vs">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</frag>
    <frag id="43007019" type="vs">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</frag>
    <frag id="43007020" type="vs">The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</frag>
    <frag id="43007021" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</frag>
    <frag id="43007022" type="vs">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</frag>
    <frag id="43007023" type="vs">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</frag>
    <frag id="43007024" type="vs">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</frag>
    <frag id="43007025" type="vs">Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</frag>
    <frag id="43007026" type="vs">But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</frag>
    <frag id="43007027" type="vs">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</frag>
    <frag id="43007028" type="vs">Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</frag>
    <frag id="43007029" type="vs">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43007030" type="vs">Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</frag>
    <frag id="43007031" type="vs">And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</frag>
    <frag id="43007032" type="vs">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</frag>
    <frag id="43007033" type="vs">Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43007034" type="vs">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</frag>
    <frag id="43007035" type="vs">Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</frag>
    <frag id="43007036" type="vs">What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</frag>
    <frag id="43007037" type="vs">In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</frag>
    <frag id="43007038" type="vs">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</frag>
    <frag id="43007039" type="vs">But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</frag>
    <frag id="43007040" type="vs">Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</frag>

    <frag id="43007043" type="vs">So there was a division among the people because of him.</frag>
    <frag id="43007044" type="vs">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</frag>
    <frag id="43007045" type="vs">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</frag>

    <frag id="43007052" type="vs">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</frag>

  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43008">
    <frag id="43008001" type="vs">Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</frag>
    <frag id="43008002" type="vs">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</frag>
    <frag id="43008003" type="vs">And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</frag>
    <frag id="43008004" type="vs">They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</frag>
    <frag id="43008005" type="vs">Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</frag>
    <frag id="43008006" type="vs">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</frag>
    <frag id="43008007" type="vs">So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</frag>
    <frag id="43008008" type="vs">And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</frag>
    <frag id="43008009" type="vs">And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</frag>
    <frag id="43008010" type="vs">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</frag>
    <frag id="43008011" type="vs">She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</frag>
    <frag id="43008012" type="vs">Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</frag>
    <frag id="43008013" type="vs">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</frag>
    <frag id="43008014" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</frag>
    <frag id="43008015" type="vs">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</frag>
    <frag id="43008016" type="vs">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43008017" type="vs">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</frag>
    <frag id="43008018" type="vs">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</frag>
    <frag id="43008019" type="vs">Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</frag>
    <frag id="43008020" type="vs">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</frag>
    <frag id="43008021" type="vs">Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</frag>
    <frag id="43008022" type="vs">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</frag>
    <frag id="43008023" type="vs">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</frag>
    <frag id="43008024" type="vs">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</frag>
    <frag id="43008025" type="vs">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</frag>
    <frag id="43008026" type="vs">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</frag>
    <frag id="43008027" type="vs">They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</frag>
    <frag id="43008028" type="vs">Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</frag>
    <frag id="43008029" type="vs">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</frag>
    <frag id="43008030" type="vs">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</frag>
    <frag id="43008031" type="vs">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</frag>
    <frag id="43008032" type="vs">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</frag>
    <frag id="43008033" type="vs">They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</frag>
    <frag id="43008034" type="vs">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</frag>
    <frag id="43008035" type="vs">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</frag>
    <frag id="43008036" type="vs">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</frag>
    <frag id="43008037" type="vs">I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</frag>
    <frag id="43008038" type="vs">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</frag>
    <frag id="43008039" type="vs">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</frag>
    <frag id="43008040" type="vs">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</frag>
    <frag id="43008041" type="vs">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</frag>
    <frag id="43008042" type="vs">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43008043" type="vs">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</frag>
    <frag id="43008044" type="vs">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</frag>
    <frag id="43008045" type="vs">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</frag>
    <frag id="43008046" type="vs">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</frag>
    <frag id="43008047" type="vs">He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</frag>
    <frag id="43008048" type="vs">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</frag>
    <frag id="43008049" type="vs">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</frag>
    <frag id="43008050" type="vs">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</frag>
    <frag id="43008051" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</frag>
    <frag id="43008052" type="vs">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</frag>
    <frag id="43008053" type="vs">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</frag>
    <frag id="43008054" type="vs">Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</frag>
    <frag id="43008055" type="vs">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</frag>
    <frag id="43008056" type="vs">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</frag>
    <frag id="43008057" type="vs">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</frag>
    <frag id="43008058" type="vs">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</frag>
    <frag id="43008059" type="vs">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</frag>

    <frag id="43009001" type="vs">And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</frag>
    <frag id="43009002" type="vs">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</frag>
    <frag id="43009003" type="vs">Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</frag>
    <frag id="43009004" type="vs">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</frag>
    <frag id="43009005" type="vs">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43009006" type="vs">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</frag>
    <frag id="43009007" type="vs">And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</frag>
    <frag id="43009008" type="vs">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</frag>
    <frag id="43009009" type="vs">Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</frag>
    <frag id="43009010" type="vs">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</frag>
    <frag id="43009011" type="vs">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</frag>
    <frag id="43009012" type="vs">Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</frag>
    <frag id="43009013" type="vs">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</frag>
    <frag id="43009014" type="vs">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</frag>
    <frag id="43009015" type="vs">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</frag>
    <frag id="43009016" type="vs">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</frag>
    <frag id="43009017" type="vs">They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</frag>
    <frag id="43009018" type="vs">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</frag>
    <frag id="43009019" type="vs">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</frag>
    <frag id="43009020" type="vs">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</frag>
    <frag id="43009021" type="vs">But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</frag>
    <frag id="43009022" type="vs">These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</frag>
    <frag id="43009023" type="vs">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</frag>
    <frag id="43009024" type="vs">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</frag>

    <frag id="43009026" type="vs">Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</frag>
    <frag id="43009027" type="vs">He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</frag>
    <frag id="43009028" type="vs">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</frag>

    <frag id="43009030" type="vs">The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</frag>
    <frag id="43009031" type="vs">Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</frag>
    <frag id="43009032" type="vs">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</frag>
    <frag id="43009033" type="vs">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</frag>
    <frag id="43009034" type="vs">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</frag>
    <frag id="43009035" type="vs">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</frag>
    <frag id="43009036" type="vs">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</frag>
    <frag id="43009037" type="vs">And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</frag>
    <frag id="43009038" type="vs">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</frag>
    <frag id="43009039" type="vs">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</frag>
    <frag id="43009040" type="vs">And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</frag>

    <frag id="43011011" type="vs">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</frag>
    <frag id="43011012" type="vs">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</frag>
    <frag id="43011013" type="vs">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</frag>
    <frag id="43011014" type="vs">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</frag>
    <frag id="43011015" type="vs">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="43011016" type="vs">Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</frag>
    <frag id="43011017" type="vs">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</frag>
    <frag id="43011018" type="vs">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</frag>
    <frag id="43011019" type="vs">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</frag>
    <frag id="43011020" type="vs">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</frag>
    <frag id="43011021" type="vs">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</frag>
    <frag id="43011022" type="vs">But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</frag>
    <frag id="43011023" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</frag>
    <frag id="43011024" type="vs">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</frag>
    <frag id="43011025" type="vs">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</frag>
    <frag id="43011026" type="vs">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</frag>
    <frag id="43011027" type="vs">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43011028" type="vs">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</frag>
    <frag id="43011029" type="vs">As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="43011030" type="vs">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</frag>
    <frag id="43011031" type="vs">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</frag>
    <frag id="43011032" type="vs">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</frag>
    <frag id="43011033" type="vs">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</frag>
    <frag id="43011034" type="vs">And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</frag>
    <frag id="43011035" type="vs">Jesus wept.</frag>
    <frag id="43011036" type="vs">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</frag>
    <frag id="43011037" type="vs">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</frag>
    <frag id="43011038" type="vs">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</frag>
    <frag id="43011039" type="vs">Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</frag>
    <frag id="43011040" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</frag>
    <frag id="43011041" type="vs">Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</frag>
    <frag id="43011042" type="vs">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43011043" type="vs">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</frag>
    <frag id="43011044" type="vs">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</frag>
    <frag id="43011045" type="vs">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</frag>
    <frag id="43011046" type="vs">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</frag>
    <frag id="43011047" type="vs">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</frag>
    <frag id="43011048" type="vs">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</frag>
    <frag id="43011049" type="vs">And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</frag>
    <frag id="43011050" type="vs">Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</frag>
    <frag id="43011051" type="vs">And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</frag>
    <frag id="43011052" type="vs">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</frag>
    <frag id="43011053" type="vs">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</frag>
    <frag id="43011054" type="vs">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</frag>
    <frag id="43011055" type="vs">And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</frag>
    <frag id="43011056" type="vs">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</frag>
    <frag id="43011057" type="vs">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43012">
    <frag id="43012001" type="vs">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</frag>
    <frag id="43012002" type="vs">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</frag>
    <frag id="43012003" type="vs">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</frag>
    <frag id="43012004" type="vs">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</frag>
    <frag id="43012005" type="vs">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</frag>
    <frag id="43012006" type="vs">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</frag>
    <frag id="43012007" type="vs">Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</frag>
    <frag id="43012008" type="vs">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</frag>
    <frag id="43012009" type="vs">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</frag>
    <frag id="43012010" type="vs">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</frag>
    <frag id="43012011" type="vs">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43012012" type="vs">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</frag>
    <frag id="43012013" type="vs">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</frag>
    <frag id="43012014" type="vs">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</frag>
    <frag id="43012015" type="vs">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</frag>
    <frag id="43012016" type="vs">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="43012017" type="vs">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</frag>
    <frag id="43012018" type="vs">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</frag>
    <frag id="43012019" type="vs">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</frag>
    <frag id="43012020" type="vs">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</frag>
    <frag id="43012021" type="vs">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43012022" type="vs">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43012023" type="vs">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</frag>
    <frag id="43012024" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</frag>
    <frag id="43012025" type="vs">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</frag>
    <frag id="43012026" type="vs">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</frag>
    <frag id="43012027" type="vs">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</frag>
    <frag id="43012028" type="vs">Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</frag>
    <frag id="43012029" type="vs">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</frag>
    <frag id="43012030" type="vs">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</frag>
    <frag id="43012031" type="vs">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</frag>
    <frag id="43012032" type="vs">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</frag>
    <frag id="43012033" type="vs">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</frag>
    <frag id="43012034" type="vs">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</frag>
    <frag id="43012035" type="vs">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</frag>
    <frag id="43012036" type="vs">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</frag>
    <frag id="43012037" type="vs">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</frag>
    <frag id="43012038" type="vs">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</frag>
    <frag id="43012039" type="vs">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</frag>
    <frag id="43012040" type="vs">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</frag>
    <frag id="43012041" type="vs">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</frag>
    <frag id="43012042" type="vs">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</frag>
    <frag id="43012043" type="vs">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</frag>
    <frag id="43012044" type="vs">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43012045" type="vs">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43012046" type="vs">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</frag>
    <frag id="43012047" type="vs">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</frag>
    <frag id="43012048" type="vs">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</frag>
    <frag id="43012049" type="vs">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</frag>
    <frag id="43012050" type="vs">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43013">
    <frag id="43013001" type="vs">Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</frag>
    <frag id="43013002" type="vs">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;</frag>
    <frag id="43013003" type="vs">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</frag>
    <frag id="43013004" type="vs">He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</frag>
    <frag id="43013005" type="vs">After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</frag>
    <frag id="43013006" type="vs">Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</frag>
    <frag id="43013007" type="vs">Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</frag>
    <frag id="43013008" type="vs">Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</frag>
    <frag id="43013009" type="vs">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</frag>
    <frag id="43013010" type="vs">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</frag>
    <frag id="43013011" type="vs">For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</frag>
    <frag id="43013012" type="vs">So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</frag>
    <frag id="43013013" type="vs">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</frag>
    <frag id="43013014" type="vs">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</frag>
    <frag id="43013015" type="vs">For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</frag>
    <frag id="43013016" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</frag>
    <frag id="43013017" type="vs">If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</frag>
    <frag id="43013018" type="vs">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</frag>
    <frag id="43013019" type="vs">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</frag>
    <frag id="43013020" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</frag>
    <frag id="43013021" type="vs">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</frag>
    <frag id="43013022" type="vs">Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</frag>
    <frag id="43013023" type="vs">Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</frag>
    <frag id="43013024" type="vs">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</frag>
    <frag id="43013025" type="vs">He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</frag>
    <frag id="43013026" type="vs">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</frag>
    <frag id="43013027" type="vs">And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</frag>
    <frag id="43013028" type="vs">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="43013029" type="vs">For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</frag>
    <frag id="43013030" type="vs">He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</frag>
    <frag id="43013031" type="vs">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</frag>
    <frag id="43013032" type="vs">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</frag>
    <frag id="43013033" type="vs">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</frag>
    <frag id="43013034" type="vs">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</frag>
    <frag id="43013035" type="vs">By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</frag>
    <frag id="43013036" type="vs">Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</frag>
    <frag id="43013037" type="vs">Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</frag>
    <frag id="43013038" type="vs">Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</frag>

    <frag id="43019020" type="vs">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</frag>
    <frag id="43019021" type="vs">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</frag>
    <frag id="43019022" type="vs">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</frag>
    <frag id="43019023" type="vs">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</frag>
    <frag id="43019024" type="vs">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</frag>
    <frag id="43019025" type="vs">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</frag>
    <frag id="43019026" type="vs">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</frag>
    <frag id="43019027" type="vs">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</frag>
    <frag id="43019028" type="vs">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</frag>
    <frag id="43019029" type="vs">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</frag>
    <frag id="43019030" type="vs">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</frag>
    <frag id="43019031" type="vs">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</frag>
    <frag id="43019032" type="vs">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</frag>
    <frag id="43019033" type="vs">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</frag>
    <frag id="43019034" type="vs">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</frag>
    <frag id="43019035" type="vs">And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</frag>
    <frag id="43019036" type="vs">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</frag>
    <frag id="43019037" type="vs">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</frag>
    <frag id="43019038" type="vs">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43019039" type="vs">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</frag>
    <frag id="43019040" type="vs">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</frag>
    <frag id="43019041" type="vs">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</frag>
    <frag id="43019042" type="vs">There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43020">
    <frag id="43020001" type="vs">The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</frag>
    <frag id="43020002" type="vs">Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</frag>
    <frag id="43020003" type="vs">Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</frag>
    <frag id="43020004" type="vs">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</frag>
    <frag id="43020005" type="vs">And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</frag>
    <frag id="43020006" type="vs">Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</frag>
    <frag id="43020007" type="vs">And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</frag>
    <frag id="43020008" type="vs">Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</frag>
    <frag id="43020009" type="vs">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</frag>
    <frag id="43020010" type="vs">Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</frag>
    <frag id="43020011" type="vs">But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</frag>
    <frag id="43020012" type="vs">And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</frag>
    <frag id="43020013" type="vs">And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</frag>
    <frag id="43020014" type="vs">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43020015" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</frag>
    <frag id="43020016" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</frag>
    <frag id="43020017" type="vs">Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</frag>
    <frag id="43020018" type="vs">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</frag>
    <frag id="43020019" type="vs">Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</frag>
    <frag id="43020020" type="vs">And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</frag>
    <frag id="43020021" type="vs">Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</frag>
    <frag id="43020022" type="vs">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</frag>
    <frag id="43020023" type="vs">Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</frag>
    <frag id="43020024" type="vs">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</frag>
    <frag id="43020025" type="vs">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</frag>
    <frag id="43020026" type="vs">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</frag>
    <frag id="43020027" type="vs">Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</frag>
    <frag id="43020028" type="vs">And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</frag>
    <frag id="43020029" type="vs">Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</frag>
    <frag id="43020030" type="vs">And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</frag>
    <frag id="43020031" type="vs">But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="43021">
    <frag id="43021001" type="vs">After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.</frag>
    <frag id="43021002" type="vs">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</frag>
    <frag id="43021003" type="vs">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</frag>
    <frag id="43021004" type="vs">But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</frag>
    <frag id="43021005" type="vs">Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</frag>
    <frag id="43021006" type="vs">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</frag>
    <frag id="43021007" type="vs">Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</frag>
    <frag id="43021008" type="vs">And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</frag>
    <frag id="43021009" type="vs">As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</frag>
    <frag id="43021010" type="vs">Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</frag>
    <frag id="43021011" type="vs">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</frag>
    <frag id="43021012" type="vs">Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</frag>
    <frag id="43021013" type="vs">Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</frag>
    <frag id="43021014" type="vs">This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</frag>
    <frag id="43021015" type="vs">So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</frag>
    <frag id="43021016" type="vs">He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</frag>
    <frag id="43021017" type="vs">He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</frag>
    <frag id="43021018" type="vs">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</frag>
    <frag id="43021019" type="vs">This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</frag>
    <frag id="43021020" type="vs">Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</frag>
    <frag id="43021021" type="vs">Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</frag>
    <frag id="43021022" type="vs">Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</frag>
    <frag id="43021023" type="vs">Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</frag>
    <frag id="43021024" type="vs">This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</frag>
    <frag id="43021025" type="vs">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</frag>
