        <fragment id="55001002" kind="vs">To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001003" kind="vs">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001004" kind="vs">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001005" kind="vs">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001006" kind="vs">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001007" kind="vs">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001008" kind="vs">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001009" kind="vs">Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001010" kind="vs">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001011" kind="vs">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001012" kind="vs">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001013" kind="vs">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001014" kind="vs">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001015" kind="vs">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001016" kind="vs">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001017" kind="vs">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55001018" kind="vs">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</fragment>

        <fragment id="55002002" kind="vs">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002003" kind="vs">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002004" kind="vs">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002005" kind="vs">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002006" kind="vs">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002007" kind="vs">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002008" kind="vs">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002009" kind="vs">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002010" kind="vs">Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002011" kind="vs">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002012" kind="vs">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002013" kind="vs">If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002014" kind="vs">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002015" kind="vs">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002016" kind="vs">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002017" kind="vs">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002018" kind="vs">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002019" kind="vs">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002020" kind="vs">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002021" kind="vs">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002022" kind="vs">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002023" kind="vs">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002024" kind="vs">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002025" kind="vs">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</fragment>
        <fragment id="55002026" kind="vs">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</fragment>

        <fragment id="55003002" kind="vs">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003003" kind="vs">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</fragment>

        <fragment id="55003005" kind="vs">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003006" kind="vs">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</fragment>

        <fragment id="55003008" kind="vs">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003009" kind="vs">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003010" kind="vs">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003011" kind="vs">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003012" kind="vs">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003013" kind="vs">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003014" kind="vs">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003015" kind="vs">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55003016" kind="vs">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</fragment>

        <fragment id="55004002" kind="vs">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</fragment>
        <fragment id="55004003" kind="vs">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</fragment>

        <fragment id="55004010" kind="vs">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</fragment>

        <fragment id="55004016" kind="vs">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</fragment>
