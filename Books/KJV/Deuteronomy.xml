    <chapter id="5001">
      <block id="5001001" type="v">These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</block>
      <block id="5001002" type="v">(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</block>
      <block id="5001003" type="v">And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</block>
      <block id="5001004" type="v">After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</block>
      <block id="5001005" type="v">On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</block>
      <block id="5001006" type="v">The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</block>
      <block id="5001007" type="v">Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</block>
      <block id="5001008" type="v">Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</block>
      <block id="5001009" type="v">And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</block>
      <block id="5001010" type="v">The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</block>
      <block id="5001011" type="v">(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</block>
      <block id="5001012" type="v">How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</block>
      <block id="5001013" type="v">Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</block>
      <block id="5001014" type="v">And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.</block>
      <block id="5001015" type="v">So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</block>
      <block id="5001016" type="v">And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</block>
      <block id="5001017" type="v">Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</block>
      <block id="5001018" type="v">And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</block>
      <block id="5001019" type="v">And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</block>
      <block id="5001020" type="v">And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</block>
      <block id="5001021" type="v">Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</block>
      <block id="5001022" type="v">And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</block>
      <block id="5001023" type="v">And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</block>
      <block id="5001024" type="v">And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</block>
      <block id="5001025" type="v">And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</block>
      <block id="5001026" type="v">Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</block>
      <block id="5001027" type="v">And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</block>
      <block id="5001028" type="v">Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</block>
      <block id="5001029" type="v">Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</block>
      <block id="5001030" type="v">The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</block>
      <block id="5001031" type="v">And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</block>
      <block id="5001032" type="v">Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</block>
      <block id="5001033" type="v">Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</block>
      <block id="5001034" type="v">And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</block>
      <block id="5001035" type="v">Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</block>
      <block id="5001036" type="v">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</block>
      <block id="5001037" type="v">Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</block>
      <block id="5001038" type="v">But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</block>
      <block id="5001039" type="v">Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</block>
      <block id="5001040" type="v">But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</block>
      <block id="5001041" type="v">Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</block>
      <block id="5001042" type="v">And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</block>
      <block id="5001043" type="v">So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</block>
      <block id="5001044" type="v">And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</block>
      <block id="5001045" type="v">And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</block>
      <block id="5001046" type="v">So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="5002">
      <block id="5002001" type="v">Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</block>
      <block id="5002002" type="v">And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</block>
      <block id="5002003" type="v">Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</block>
      <block id="5002004" type="v">And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</block>
      <block id="5002005" type="v">Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</block>
      <block id="5002006" type="v">Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</block>
      <block id="5002007" type="v">For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</block>
      <block id="5002008" type="v">And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</block>
      <block id="5002009" type="v">And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</block>
      <block id="5002010" type="v">The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</block>
      <block id="5002011" type="v">Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</block>
      <block id="5002012" type="v">The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</block>
      <block id="5002013" type="v">Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</block>
      <block id="5002014" type="v">And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</block>
      <block id="5002015" type="v">For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</block>
      <block id="5002016" type="v">So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</block>
      <block id="5002017" type="v">That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</block>
      <block id="5002018" type="v">Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</block>
      <block id="5002019" type="v">And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</block>
      <block id="5002020" type="v">(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</block>
      <block id="5002021" type="v">A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</block>
      <block id="5002022" type="v">As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</block>
      <block id="5002023" type="v">And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</block>
      <block id="5002024" type="v">Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</block>
      <block id="5002025" type="v">This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</block>
      <block id="5002026" type="v">And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</block>
      <block id="5002027" type="v">Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</block>
      <block id="5002028" type="v">Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</block>
      <block id="5002029" type="v">(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</block>
      <block id="5002030" type="v">But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</block>
      <block id="5002031" type="v">And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</block>
      <block id="5002032" type="v">Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</block>
      <block id="5002033" type="v">And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</block>
      <block id="5002034" type="v">And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</block>
      <block id="5002035" type="v">Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</block>
      <block id="5002036" type="v">From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</block>
      <block id="5002037" type="v">Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="5003">
      <block id="5003001" type="v">Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</block>
      <block id="5003002" type="v">And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</block>
      <block id="5003003" type="v">So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</block>
      <block id="5003004" type="v">And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</block>
      <block id="5003005" type="v">All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</block>
      <block id="5003006" type="v">And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</block>
      <block id="5003007" type="v">But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</block>
      <block id="5003008" type="v">And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</block>
      <block id="5003009" type="v">(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</block>
      <block id="5003010" type="v">All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</block>
      <block id="5003011" type="v">For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</block>
      <block id="5003012" type="v">And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</block>
      <block id="5003013" type="v">And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</block>
      <block id="5003014" type="v">Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</block>
      <block id="5003015" type="v">And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</block>
      <block id="5003016" type="v">And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</block>
      <block id="5003017" type="v">The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</block>
      <block id="5003018" type="v">And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</block>
      <block id="5003019" type="v">But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</block>
      <block id="5003020" type="v">Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</block>
      <block id="5003021" type="v">And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</block>
      <block id="5003022" type="v">Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</block>
      <block id="5003023" type="v">And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</block>
      <block id="5003024" type="v">O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</block>
      <block id="5003025" type="v">I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</block>
      <block id="5003026" type="v">But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</block>
      <block id="5003027" type="v">Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</block>
      <block id="5003028" type="v">But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</block>
      <block id="5003029" type="v">So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="5004">
      <block id="5004001" type="v">Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.</block>
      <block id="5004002" type="v">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</block>
      <block id="5004003" type="v">Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.</block>
      <block id="5004004" type="v">But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.</block>
      <block id="5004005" type="v">Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.</block>
      <block id="5004006" type="v">Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</block>
      <block id="5004007" type="v">For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</block>
      <block id="5004008" type="v">And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</block>
      <block id="5004009" type="v">Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;</block>
      <block id="5004010" type="v">Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.</block>
      <block id="5004011" type="v">And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</block>
      <block id="5004012" type="v">And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</block>
      <block id="5004013" type="v">And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</block>
      <block id="5004014" type="v">And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.</block>
      <block id="5004015" type="v">Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</block>
      <block id="5004016" type="v">Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</block>
      <block id="5004017" type="v">The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,</block>
      <block id="5004018" type="v">The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:</block>
      <block id="5004019" type="v">And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.</block>
      <block id="5004020" type="v">But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.</block>

      <block id="5009003" type="v">Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</block>
      <block id="5009004" type="v">Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</block>
      <block id="5009005" type="v">Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</block>
      <block id="5009006" type="v">Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.</block>
      <block id="5009007" type="v">Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</block>
      <block id="5009008" type="v">Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</block>
      <block id="5009009" type="v">When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</block>
      <block id="5009010" type="v">And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</block>
      <block id="5009011" type="v">And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</block>
      <block id="5009012" type="v">And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</block>
      <block id="5009013" type="v">Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</block>
      <block id="5009014" type="v">Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</block>
      <block id="5009015" type="v">So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</block>
      <block id="5009016" type="v">And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</block>
      <block id="5009017" type="v">And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</block>
      <block id="5009018" type="v">And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</block>
      <block id="5009019" type="v">For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</block>
      <block id="5009020" type="v">And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</block>
      <block id="5009021" type="v">And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</block>
      <block id="5009022" type="v">And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</block>
      <block id="5009023" type="v">Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</block>
      <block id="5009024" type="v">Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</block>
      <block id="5009025" type="v">Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</block>
      <block id="5009026" type="v">I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</block>
      <block id="5009027" type="v">Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</block>
      <block id="5009028" type="v">Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</block>
      <block id="5009029" type="v">Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="5010">
      <block id="5010001" type="v">At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.</block>
      <block id="5010002" type="v">And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.</block>
      <block id="5010003" type="v">And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.</block>

      <block id="5010008" type="v">At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.</block>

      <block id="5010010" type="v">And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.</block>
      <block id="5010011" type="v">And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.</block>
      <block id="5010012" type="v">And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,</block>

      <block id="5010017" type="v">For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:</block>

      <block id="5010019" type="v">Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</block>
      <block id="5010020" type="v">Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.</block>

      <block id="5031009" type="v">And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.</block>
      <block id="5031010" type="v">And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,</block>

      <block id="5031021" type="v">And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.</block>

      <block id="5031028" type="v">Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</block>
      <block id="5031029" type="v">For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.</block>

      <block id="5032015" type="v">But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</block>

      <block id="5032017" type="v">They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</block>

      <block id="5032020" type="v">And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.</block>
      <block id="5032021" type="v">They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</block>
      <block id="5032022" type="v">For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</block>

      <block id="5033007" type="v">And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</block>
      <block id="5033008" type="v">And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</block>

      <block id="5034001" type="v">And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,</block>
      <block id="5034002" type="v">And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,</block>
      <block id="5034003" type="v">And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</block>
      <block id="5034004" type="v">And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.</block>
      <block id="5034005" type="v">So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.</block>
      <block id="5034006" type="v">And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.</block>
      <block id="5034007" type="v">And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</block>
      <block id="5034008" type="v">And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.</block>
      <block id="5034009" type="v">And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.</block>
      <block id="5034010" type="v">And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</block>
      <block id="5034011" type="v">In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</block>
      <block id="5034012" type="v">And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.</block>
