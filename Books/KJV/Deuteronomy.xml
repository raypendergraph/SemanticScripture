        <fragment id="5001001" kind="vs">These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001002" kind="vs">(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001003" kind="vs">And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001004" kind="vs">After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001005" kind="vs">On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001006" kind="vs">The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001007" kind="vs">Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001008" kind="vs">Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001009" kind="vs">And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001010" kind="vs">The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001011" kind="vs">(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001012" kind="vs">How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001013" kind="vs">Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001014" kind="vs">And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001015" kind="vs">So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001016" kind="vs">And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001017" kind="vs">Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001018" kind="vs">And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001019" kind="vs">And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001020" kind="vs">And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001021" kind="vs">Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001022" kind="vs">And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001023" kind="vs">And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001024" kind="vs">And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001025" kind="vs">And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001026" kind="vs">Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001027" kind="vs">And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001028" kind="vs">Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001029" kind="vs">Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001030" kind="vs">The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001031" kind="vs">And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001032" kind="vs">Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001033" kind="vs">Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001034" kind="vs">And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001035" kind="vs">Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001036" kind="vs">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001037" kind="vs">Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001038" kind="vs">But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001039" kind="vs">Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001040" kind="vs">But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001041" kind="vs">Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001042" kind="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001043" kind="vs">So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001044" kind="vs">And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001045" kind="vs">And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5001046" kind="vs">So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.</fragment>

        <fragment id="5002001" kind="vs">Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002002" kind="vs">And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002003" kind="vs">Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002004" kind="vs">And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002005" kind="vs">Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002006" kind="vs">Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002007" kind="vs">For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002008" kind="vs">And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002009" kind="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002010" kind="vs">The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002011" kind="vs">Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002012" kind="vs">The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002013" kind="vs">Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002014" kind="vs">And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002015" kind="vs">For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002016" kind="vs">So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002017" kind="vs">That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002018" kind="vs">Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002019" kind="vs">And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002020" kind="vs">(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002021" kind="vs">A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002022" kind="vs">As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002023" kind="vs">And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</fragment>

        <fragment id="5002025" kind="vs">This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002026" kind="vs">And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002027" kind="vs">Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002028" kind="vs">Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</fragment>

        <fragment id="5002030" kind="vs">But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002031" kind="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002032" kind="vs">Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002033" kind="vs">And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002034" kind="vs">And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002035" kind="vs">Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002036" kind="vs">From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</fragment>
        <fragment id="5002037" kind="vs">Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</fragment>

        <fragment id="5003002" kind="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</fragment>
