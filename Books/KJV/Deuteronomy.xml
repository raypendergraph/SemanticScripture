    <frag id="5001001" type="vs">These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</frag>
    <frag id="5001002" type="vs">(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</frag>
    <frag id="5001003" type="vs">And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</frag>
    <frag id="5001004" type="vs">After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</frag>
    <frag id="5001005" type="vs">On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="5001006" type="vs">The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</frag>
    <frag id="5001007" type="vs">Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</frag>
    <frag id="5001008" type="vs">Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</frag>
    <frag id="5001009" type="vs">And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</frag>
    <frag id="5001010" type="vs">The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</frag>
    <frag id="5001011" type="vs">(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</frag>
    <frag id="5001012" type="vs">How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</frag>
    <frag id="5001013" type="vs">Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</frag>
    <frag id="5001014" type="vs">And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.</frag>
    <frag id="5001015" type="vs">So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</frag>
    <frag id="5001016" type="vs">And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</frag>
    <frag id="5001017" type="vs">Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</frag>
    <frag id="5001018" type="vs">And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</frag>
    <frag id="5001019" type="vs">And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</frag>
    <frag id="5001020" type="vs">And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</frag>
    <frag id="5001021" type="vs">Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</frag>
    <frag id="5001022" type="vs">And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</frag>
    <frag id="5001023" type="vs">And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</frag>
    <frag id="5001024" type="vs">And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</frag>
    <frag id="5001025" type="vs">And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</frag>
    <frag id="5001026" type="vs">Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</frag>
    <frag id="5001027" type="vs">And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</frag>
    <frag id="5001028" type="vs">Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</frag>
    <frag id="5001029" type="vs">Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</frag>
    <frag id="5001030" type="vs">The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</frag>
    <frag id="5001031" type="vs">And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</frag>
    <frag id="5001032" type="vs">Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</frag>
    <frag id="5001033" type="vs">Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</frag>
    <frag id="5001034" type="vs">And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="5001035" type="vs">Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</frag>
    <frag id="5001036" type="vs">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="5001037" type="vs">Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</frag>
    <frag id="5001038" type="vs">But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</frag>
    <frag id="5001039" type="vs">Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</frag>
    <frag id="5001040" type="vs">But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</frag>
    <frag id="5001041" type="vs">Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</frag>
    <frag id="5001042" type="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</frag>
    <frag id="5001043" type="vs">So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</frag>
    <frag id="5001044" type="vs">And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</frag>
    <frag id="5001045" type="vs">And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</frag>
    <frag id="5001046" type="vs">So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="5002">
    <frag id="5002001" type="vs">Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</frag>
    <frag id="5002002" type="vs">And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="5002003" type="vs">Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</frag>
    <frag id="5002004" type="vs">And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</frag>
    <frag id="5002005" type="vs">Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</frag>
    <frag id="5002006" type="vs">Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</frag>
    <frag id="5002007" type="vs">For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</frag>
    <frag id="5002008" type="vs">And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</frag>
    <frag id="5002009" type="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</frag>
    <frag id="5002010" type="vs">The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</frag>
    <frag id="5002011" type="vs">Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</frag>
    <frag id="5002012" type="vs">The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</frag>
    <frag id="5002013" type="vs">Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</frag>
    <frag id="5002014" type="vs">And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</frag>
    <frag id="5002015" type="vs">For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</frag>
    <frag id="5002016" type="vs">So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</frag>
    <frag id="5002017" type="vs">That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="5002018" type="vs">Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</frag>
    <frag id="5002019" type="vs">And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</frag>
    <frag id="5002020" type="vs">(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</frag>
    <frag id="5002021" type="vs">A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</frag>
    <frag id="5002022" type="vs">As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</frag>
    <frag id="5002023" type="vs">And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</frag>
    <frag id="5002024" type="vs">Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</frag>
    <frag id="5002025" type="vs">This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</frag>
    <frag id="5002026" type="vs">And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="5002027" type="vs">Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</frag>
    <frag id="5002028" type="vs">Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</frag>
    <frag id="5002029" type="vs">(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</frag>
    <frag id="5002030" type="vs">But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</frag>
    <frag id="5002031" type="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</frag>
    <frag id="5002032" type="vs">Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</frag>
    <frag id="5002033" type="vs">And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</frag>
    <frag id="5002034" type="vs">And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</frag>
    <frag id="5002035" type="vs">Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</frag>
    <frag id="5002036" type="vs">From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</frag>
    <frag id="5002037" type="vs">Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="5003">
    <frag id="5003001" type="vs">Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</frag>
    <frag id="5003002" type="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</frag>
    <frag id="5003003" type="vs">So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</frag>
    <frag id="5003004" type="vs">And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</frag>
    <frag id="5003005" type="vs">All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</frag>
    <frag id="5003006" type="vs">And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</frag>
    <frag id="5003007" type="vs">But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</frag>
    <frag id="5003008" type="vs">And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</frag>
    <frag id="5003009" type="vs">(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</frag>
    <frag id="5003010" type="vs">All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</frag>
    <frag id="5003011" type="vs">For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</frag>
    <frag id="5003012" type="vs">And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</frag>
    <frag id="5003013" type="vs">And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</frag>
    <frag id="5003014" type="vs">Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</frag>
    <frag id="5003015" type="vs">And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</frag>
    <frag id="5003016" type="vs">And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</frag>
    <frag id="5003017" type="vs">The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</frag>
    <frag id="5003018" type="vs">And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</frag>
    <frag id="5003019" type="vs">But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</frag>
    <frag id="5003020" type="vs">Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</frag>
    <frag id="5003021" type="vs">And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</frag>
    <frag id="5003022" type="vs">Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</frag>
    <frag id="5003023" type="vs">And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="5003024" type="vs">O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</frag>
    <frag id="5003025" type="vs">I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</frag>
    <frag id="5003026" type="vs">But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</frag>
    <frag id="5003027" type="vs">Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</frag>
    <frag id="5003028" type="vs">But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</frag>
    <frag id="5003029" type="vs">So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="5004">
    <frag id="5004001" type="vs">Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.</frag>
    <frag id="5004002" type="vs">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</frag>
    <frag id="5004003" type="vs">Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.</frag>
    <frag id="5004004" type="vs">But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.</frag>
    <frag id="5004005" type="vs">Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.</frag>

    <frag id="5004009" type="vs">Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;</frag>
    <frag id="5004010" type="vs">Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.</frag>
    <frag id="5004011" type="vs">And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</frag>
    <frag id="5004012" type="vs">And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</frag>
    <frag id="5004013" type="vs">And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</frag>
    <frag id="5004014" type="vs">And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.</frag>
    <frag id="5004015" type="vs">Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</frag>
    <frag id="5004016" type="vs">Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</frag>
    <frag id="5004017" type="vs">The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,</frag>
    <frag id="5004018" type="vs">The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:</frag>
    <frag id="5004019" type="vs">And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.</frag>
    <frag id="5004020" type="vs">But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.</frag>
    <frag id="5004021" type="vs">Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:</frag>
    <frag id="5004022" type="vs">But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.</frag>
    <frag id="5004023" type="vs">Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.</frag>
    <frag id="5004024" type="vs">For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.</frag>
    <frag id="5004025" type="vs">When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:</frag>

    <frag id="5009012" type="vs">And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</frag>
    <frag id="5009013" type="vs">Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</frag>
    <frag id="5009014" type="vs">Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</frag>
    <frag id="5009015" type="vs">So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</frag>
    <frag id="5009016" type="vs">And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</frag>
    <frag id="5009017" type="vs">And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</frag>
    <frag id="5009018" type="vs">And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</frag>
    <frag id="5009019" type="vs">For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</frag>
    <frag id="5009020" type="vs">And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</frag>
    <frag id="5009021" type="vs">And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</frag>
    <frag id="5009022" type="vs">And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</frag>
    <frag id="5009023" type="vs">Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</frag>
    <frag id="5009024" type="vs">Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</frag>
    <frag id="5009025" type="vs">Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</frag>
    <frag id="5009026" type="vs">I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</frag>
    <frag id="5009027" type="vs">Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</frag>
    <frag id="5009028" type="vs">Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</frag>
