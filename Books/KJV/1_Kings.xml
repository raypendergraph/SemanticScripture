          <ab id="11001001" type="verse">Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</ab>
          <ab id="11001002" type="verse">Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</ab>
          <ab id="11001003" type="verse">So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11001004" type="verse">And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</ab>
          <ab id="11001005" type="verse">Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</ab>
          <ab id="11001006" type="verse">And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.</ab>
          <ab id="11001007" type="verse">And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</ab>
          <ab id="11001008" type="verse">But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</ab>
          <ab id="11001009" type="verse">And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:</ab>
          <ab id="11001010" type="verse">But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</ab>
          <ab id="11001011" type="verse">Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</ab>
          <ab id="11001012" type="verse">Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</ab>
          <ab id="11001013" type="verse">Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</ab>
          <ab id="11001014" type="verse">Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</ab>
          <ab id="11001015" type="verse">And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11001016" type="verse">And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?</ab>
          <ab id="11001017" type="verse">And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</ab>
          <ab id="11001018" type="verse">And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</ab>
          <ab id="11001019" type="verse">And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</ab>
          <ab id="11001020" type="verse">And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</ab>
          <ab id="11001021" type="verse">Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</ab>
          <ab id="11001022" type="verse">And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</ab>
          <ab id="11001023" type="verse">And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</ab>
          <ab id="11001024" type="verse">And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</ab>
          <ab id="11001025" type="verse">For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</ab>
          <ab id="11001026" type="verse">But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</ab>
          <ab id="11001027" type="verse">Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</ab>
          <ab id="11001028" type="verse">Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11001029" type="verse">And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</ab>
          <ab id="11001030" type="verse">Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</ab>
          <ab id="11001031" type="verse">Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</ab>
          <ab id="11001032" type="verse">And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11001033" type="verse">The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</ab>
          <ab id="11001034" type="verse">And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</ab>
          <ab id="11001035" type="verse">Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</ab>
          <ab id="11001036" type="verse">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</ab>
          <ab id="11001037" type="verse">As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</ab>
          <ab id="11001038" type="verse">So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</ab>
          <ab id="11001039" type="verse">And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</ab>
          <ab id="11001040" type="verse">And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</ab>
          <ab id="11001041" type="verse">And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</ab>
          <ab id="11001042" type="verse">And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</ab>
          <ab id="11001043" type="verse">And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</ab>
          <ab id="11001044" type="verse">And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:</ab>
          <ab id="11001045" type="verse">And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</ab>
          <ab id="11001046" type="verse">And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</ab>
          <ab id="11001047" type="verse">And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</ab>
          <ab id="11001048" type="verse">And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</ab>
          <ab id="11001049" type="verse">And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</ab>
          <ab id="11001050" type="verse">And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</ab>
          <ab id="11001051" type="verse">And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</ab>
          <ab id="11001052" type="verse">And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</ab>
          <ab id="11001053" type="verse">So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" id="11002">
          <ab id="11002001" type="verse">Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="11002002" type="verse">I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</ab>
          <ab id="11002003" type="verse">And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</ab>
          <ab id="11002004" type="verse">That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</ab>
          <ab id="11002005" type="verse">Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</ab>
          <ab id="11002006" type="verse">Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</ab>
          <ab id="11002007" type="verse">But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</ab>
          <ab id="11002008" type="verse">And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</ab>
          <ab id="11002009" type="verse">Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</ab>
          <ab id="11002010" type="verse">So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</ab>
          <ab id="11002011" type="verse">And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="11002012" type="verse">Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</ab>
          <ab id="11002013" type="verse">And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</ab>
          <ab id="11002014" type="verse">He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</ab>
          <ab id="11002015" type="verse">And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.</ab>
          <ab id="11002016" type="verse">And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</ab>
          <ab id="11002017" type="verse">And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</ab>
          <ab id="11002018" type="verse">And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11002019" type="verse">Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</ab>
          <ab id="11002020" type="verse">Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</ab>
          <ab id="11002021" type="verse">And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</ab>
          <ab id="11002022" type="verse">And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</ab>
          <ab id="11002023" type="verse">Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</ab>
          <ab id="11002024" type="verse">Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</ab>
          <ab id="11002025" type="verse">And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</ab>
          <ab id="11002026" type="verse">And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</ab>
          <ab id="11002027" type="verse">So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</ab>
          <ab id="11002028" type="verse">Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</ab>
          <ab id="11002029" type="verse">And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</ab>
          <ab id="11002030" type="verse">And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</ab>
          <ab id="11002031" type="verse">And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</ab>
          <ab id="11002032" type="verse">And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</ab>
          <ab id="11002033" type="verse">Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</ab>
          <ab id="11002034" type="verse">So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</ab>
          <ab id="11002035" type="verse">And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</ab>
          <ab id="11002036" type="verse">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</ab>
          <ab id="11002037" type="verse">For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</ab>
          <ab id="11002038" type="verse">And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</ab>
          <ab id="11002039" type="verse">And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.</ab>
          <ab id="11002040" type="verse">And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</ab>
          <ab id="11002041" type="verse">And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</ab>
          <ab id="11002042" type="verse">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</ab>
          <ab id="11002043" type="verse">Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</ab>
          <ab id="11002044" type="verse">The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</ab>
          <ab id="11002045" type="verse">And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</ab>
          <ab id="11002046" type="verse">So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" id="11003">
          <ab id="11003001" type="verse">And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</ab>
          <ab id="11003002" type="verse">Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.</ab>
          <ab id="11003003" type="verse">And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</ab>
          <ab id="11003004" type="verse">And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</ab>
          <ab id="11003005" type="verse">In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</ab>
          <ab id="11003006" type="verse">And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</ab>
          <ab id="11003007" type="verse">And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.</ab>
          <ab id="11003008" type="verse">And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</ab>
          <ab id="11003009" type="verse">Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?</ab>
          <ab id="11003010" type="verse">And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</ab>
          <ab id="11003011" type="verse">And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</ab>
          <ab id="11003012" type="verse">Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</ab>
          <ab id="11003013" type="verse">And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.</ab>
          <ab id="11003014" type="verse">And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.</ab>
          <ab id="11003015" type="verse">And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</ab>

          <ab id="11006028" type="verse">And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</ab>
          <ab id="11006029" type="verse">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</ab>

          <ab id="11006031" type="verse">And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</ab>

          <ab id="11010001" type="verse">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.</ab>
          <ab id="11010002" type="verse">And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</ab>
          <ab id="11010003" type="verse">And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.</ab>
          <ab id="11010004" type="verse">And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,</ab>
          <ab id="11010005" type="verse">And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</ab>
          <ab id="11010006" type="verse">And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.</ab>
          <ab id="11010007" type="verse">Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</ab>
          <ab id="11010008" type="verse">Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</ab>
          <ab id="11010009" type="verse">Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.</ab>
          <ab id="11010010" type="verse">And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</ab>
          <ab id="11010011" type="verse">And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.</ab>
          <ab id="11010012" type="verse">And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.</ab>
          <ab id="11010013" type="verse">And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</ab>
          <ab id="11010014" type="verse">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</ab>
          <ab id="11010015" type="verse">Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</ab>
          <ab id="11010016" type="verse">And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</ab>
          <ab id="11010017" type="verse">And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</ab>
          <ab id="11010018" type="verse">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</ab>
          <ab id="11010019" type="verse">The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</ab>
          <ab id="11010020" type="verse">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</ab>
          <ab id="11010021" type="verse">And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</ab>
          <ab id="11010022" type="verse">For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</ab>
          <ab id="11010023" type="verse">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</ab>
          <ab id="11010024" type="verse">And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</ab>
          <ab id="11010025" type="verse">And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</ab>
          <ab id="11010026" type="verse">And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="11010027" type="verse">And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</ab>
          <ab id="11010028" type="verse">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</ab>
          <ab id="11010029" type="verse">And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</ab>

          <ab id="11011003" type="verse">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</ab>
          <ab id="11011004" type="verse">For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</ab>
          <ab id="11011005" type="verse">For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</ab>

          <ab id="11011019" type="verse">And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</ab>
          <ab id="11011020" type="verse">And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.</ab>
          <ab id="11011021" type="verse">And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.</ab>
          <ab id="11011022" type="verse">Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</ab>
          <ab id="11011023" type="verse">And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</ab>

          <ab id="11011025" type="verse">And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</ab>
          <ab id="11011026" type="verse">And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11011027" type="verse">And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.</ab>
          <ab id="11011028" type="verse">And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</ab>
          <ab id="11011029" type="verse">And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:</ab>
          <ab id="11011030" type="verse">And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:</ab>
          <ab id="11011031" type="verse">And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:</ab>
          <ab id="11011032" type="verse">(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)</ab>

          <ab id="11011034" type="verse">Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</ab>
          <ab id="11011035" type="verse">But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.</ab>
          <ab id="11011036" type="verse">And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</ab>
          <ab id="11011037" type="verse">And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</ab>
          <ab id="11011038" type="verse">And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</ab>
          <ab id="11011039" type="verse">And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</ab>
          <ab id="11011040" type="verse">Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</ab>

          <ab id="11012003" type="verse">That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</ab>

          <ab id="11012005" type="verse">And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</ab>
          <ab id="11012006" type="verse">And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</ab>
          <ab id="11012007" type="verse">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</ab>
          <ab id="11012008" type="verse">But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:</ab>
          <ab id="11012009" type="verse">And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</ab>
          <ab id="11012010" type="verse">And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.</ab>
          <ab id="11012011" type="verse">And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</ab>
          <ab id="11012012" type="verse">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</ab>
          <ab id="11012013" type="verse">And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;</ab>
          <ab id="11012014" type="verse">And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</ab>

          <ab id="11013003" type="verse">And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</ab>

          <ab id="11018003" type="verse">And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</ab>
          <ab id="11018004" type="verse">For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</ab>
          <ab id="11018005" type="verse">And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</ab>

          <ab id="11018007" type="verse">And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?</ab>

          <ab id="11018009" type="verse">And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</ab>
          <ab id="11018010" type="verse">As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</ab>

          <ab id="11018012" type="verse">And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</ab>
          <ab id="11018013" type="verse">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</ab>

          <ab id="11018019" type="verse">Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.</ab>
          <ab id="11018020" type="verse">So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</ab>
          <ab id="11018021" type="verse">And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</ab>
          <ab id="11018022" type="verse">Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</ab>
          <ab id="11018023" type="verse">Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</ab>
          <ab id="11018024" type="verse">And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</ab>
          <ab id="11018025" type="verse">And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</ab>
          <ab id="11018026" type="verse">And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</ab>
          <ab id="11018027" type="verse">And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</ab>
          <ab id="11018028" type="verse">And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</ab>
          <ab id="11018029" type="verse">And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</ab>
          <ab id="11018030" type="verse">And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</ab>
          <ab id="11018031" type="verse">And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</ab>
          <ab id="11018032" type="verse">And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</ab>
          <ab id="11018033" type="verse">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</ab>
          <ab id="11018034" type="verse">And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</ab>
          <ab id="11018035" type="verse">And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</ab>
          <ab id="11018036" type="verse">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</ab>
          <ab id="11018037" type="verse">Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</ab>
          <ab id="11018038" type="verse">Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</ab>
          <ab id="11018039" type="verse">And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</ab>
          <ab id="11018040" type="verse">And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</ab>
          <ab id="11018041" type="verse">And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</ab>
          <ab id="11018042" type="verse">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</ab>
          <ab id="11018043" type="verse">And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</ab>
          <ab id="11018044" type="verse">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.</ab>
          <ab id="11018045" type="verse">And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</ab>
          <ab id="11018046" type="verse">And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</ab>

          <ab id="11020025" type="verse">And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</ab>
          <ab id="11020026" type="verse">And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</ab>
          <ab id="11020027" type="verse">And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</ab>
          <ab id="11020028" type="verse">And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</ab>
          <ab id="11020029" type="verse">And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</ab>
          <ab id="11020030" type="verse">But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</ab>
          <ab id="11020031" type="verse">And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</ab>
          <ab id="11020032" type="verse">So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</ab>
          <ab id="11020033" type="verse">Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</ab>
          <ab id="11020034" type="verse">And Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</ab>
          <ab id="11020035" type="verse">And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.</ab>
          <ab id="11020036" type="verse">Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</ab>
          <ab id="11020037" type="verse">Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</ab>
          <ab id="11020038" type="verse">So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</ab>
          <ab id="11020039" type="verse">And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</ab>
          <ab id="11020040" type="verse">And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.</ab>
          <ab id="11020041" type="verse">And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</ab>
          <ab id="11020042" type="verse">And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</ab>
          <ab id="11020043" type="verse">And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" id="11021">
          <ab id="11021001" type="verse">And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</ab>
          <ab id="11021002" type="verse">And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</ab>
          <ab id="11021003" type="verse">And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</ab>
          <ab id="11021004" type="verse">And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</ab>
          <ab id="11021005" type="verse">But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</ab>
          <ab id="11021006" type="verse">And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</ab>
          <ab id="11021007" type="verse">And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</ab>
          <ab id="11021008" type="verse">So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</ab>
          <ab id="11021009" type="verse">And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</ab>
          <ab id="11021010" type="verse">And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</ab>
          <ab id="11021011" type="verse">And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="11021012" type="verse">They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</ab>
          <ab id="11021013" type="verse">And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</ab>
          <ab id="11021014" type="verse">Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</ab>
          <ab id="11021015" type="verse">And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</ab>
          <ab id="11021016" type="verse">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</ab>
          <ab id="11021017" type="verse">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="11021018" type="verse">Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.</ab>
          <ab id="11021019" type="verse">And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</ab>
          <ab id="11021020" type="verse">And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</ab>
          <ab id="11021021" type="verse">Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</ab>
          <ab id="11021022" type="verse">And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</ab>
          <ab id="11021023" type="verse">And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</ab>
          <ab id="11021024" type="verse">Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</ab>
          <ab id="11021025" type="verse">But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</ab>
          <ab id="11021026" type="verse">And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</ab>
          <ab id="11021027" type="verse">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</ab>
          <ab id="11021028" type="verse">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="11021029" type="verse">Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</ab>

          <ab id="11022002" type="verse">And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</ab>
          <ab id="11022003" type="verse">And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?</ab>
          <ab id="11022004" type="verse">And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</ab>
          <ab id="11022005" type="verse">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</ab>
          <ab id="11022006" type="verse">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11022007" type="verse">And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</ab>
          <ab id="11022008" type="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</ab>
          <ab id="11022009" type="verse">Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.</ab>
          <ab id="11022010" type="verse">And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</ab>
          <ab id="11022011" type="verse">And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.</ab>
          <ab id="11022012" type="verse">And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.</ab>
          <ab id="11022013" type="verse">And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</ab>
          <ab id="11022014" type="verse">And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.</ab>
          <ab id="11022015" type="verse">So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</ab>
          <ab id="11022016" type="verse">And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?</ab>
          <ab id="11022017" type="verse">And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</ab>
          <ab id="11022018" type="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</ab>
          <ab id="11022019" type="verse">And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</ab>
          <ab id="11022020" type="verse">And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</ab>
          <ab id="11022021" type="verse">And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</ab>
          <ab id="11022022" type="verse">And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</ab>
          <ab id="11022023" type="verse">Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</ab>
          <ab id="11022024" type="verse">But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</ab>
          <ab id="11022025" type="verse">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</ab>
          <ab id="11022026" type="verse">And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</ab>
          <ab id="11022027" type="verse">And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</ab>
          <ab id="11022028" type="verse">And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</ab>
