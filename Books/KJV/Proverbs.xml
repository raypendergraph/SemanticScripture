        <fragment id="20001002" kind="vs">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001003" kind="vs">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001004" kind="vs">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001005" kind="vs">A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001006" kind="vs">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001007" kind="vs">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001008" kind="vs">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001009" kind="vs">For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001010" kind="vs">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001011" kind="vs">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001012" kind="vs">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001013" kind="vs">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001014" kind="vs">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001015" kind="vs">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001016" kind="vs">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001017" kind="vs">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001018" kind="vs">And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001019" kind="vs">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001020" kind="vs">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001021" kind="vs">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001022" kind="vs">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001023" kind="vs">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001024" kind="vs">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001025" kind="vs">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001026" kind="vs">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001027" kind="vs">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001028" kind="vs">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001029" kind="vs">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001030" kind="vs">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001031" kind="vs">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001032" kind="vs">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="20001033" kind="vs">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</fragment>

        <fragment id="20002016" kind="vs">To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</fragment>
        <fragment id="20002017" kind="vs">Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</fragment>
