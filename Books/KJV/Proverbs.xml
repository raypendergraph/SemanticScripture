    <frag id="20001002" type="vs">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</frag>
    <frag id="20001003" type="vs">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</frag>
    <frag id="20001004" type="vs">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</frag>
    <frag id="20001005" type="vs">A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</frag>
    <frag id="20001006" type="vs">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</frag>
    <frag id="20001007" type="vs">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</frag>
    <frag id="20001008" type="vs">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</frag>
    <frag id="20001009" type="vs">For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</frag>
    <frag id="20001010" type="vs">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</frag>
    <frag id="20001011" type="vs">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</frag>
    <frag id="20001012" type="vs">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</frag>
    <frag id="20001013" type="vs">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</frag>
    <frag id="20001014" type="vs">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</frag>
    <frag id="20001015" type="vs">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</frag>
    <frag id="20001016" type="vs">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</frag>
    <frag id="20001017" type="vs">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</frag>
    <frag id="20001018" type="vs">And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</frag>
    <frag id="20001019" type="vs">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</frag>
    <frag id="20001020" type="vs">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</frag>
    <frag id="20001021" type="vs">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="20001022" type="vs">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</frag>
    <frag id="20001023" type="vs">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</frag>
    <frag id="20001024" type="vs">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</frag>
    <frag id="20001025" type="vs">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</frag>
    <frag id="20001026" type="vs">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</frag>
    <frag id="20001027" type="vs">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</frag>
    <frag id="20001028" type="vs">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</frag>
    <frag id="20001029" type="vs">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</frag>
    <frag id="20001030" type="vs">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</frag>
    <frag id="20001031" type="vs">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</frag>
    <frag id="20001032" type="vs">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</frag>
    <frag id="20001033" type="vs">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</frag>

    <frag id="20002008" type="vs">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</frag>
    <frag id="20002009" type="vs">Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</frag>

    <frag id="20002013" type="vs">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</frag>
    <frag id="20002014" type="vs">Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</frag>
    <frag id="20002015" type="vs">Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</frag>
    <frag id="20002016" type="vs">To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</frag>
    <frag id="20002017" type="vs">Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</frag>
    <frag id="20002018" type="vs">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</frag>
    <frag id="20002019" type="vs">None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</frag>
    <frag id="20002020" type="vs">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</frag>
    <frag id="20002021" type="vs">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</frag>
    <frag id="20002022" type="vs">But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</frag>

    <frag id="20003003" type="vs">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</frag>
    <frag id="20003004" type="vs">So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</frag>
    <frag id="20003005" type="vs">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</frag>
    <frag id="20003006" type="vs">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</frag>
    <frag id="20003007" type="vs">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</frag>
    <frag id="20003008" type="vs">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</frag>
    <frag id="20003009" type="vs">Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</frag>

    <frag id="20003011" type="vs">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</frag>
    <frag id="20003012" type="vs">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</frag>
    <frag id="20003013" type="vs">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</frag>

    <frag id="20003016" type="vs">Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.</frag>
    <frag id="20003017" type="vs">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</frag>
    <frag id="20003018" type="vs">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</frag>
    <frag id="20003019" type="vs">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</frag>
    <frag id="20003020" type="vs">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</frag>
    <frag id="20003021" type="vs">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</frag>
    <frag id="20003022" type="vs">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</frag>
    <frag id="20003023" type="vs">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</frag>
    <frag id="20003024" type="vs">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</frag>
    <frag id="20003025" type="vs">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</frag>
    <frag id="20003026" type="vs">For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</frag>
    <frag id="20003027" type="vs">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</frag>
    <frag id="20003028" type="vs">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</frag>
    <frag id="20003029" type="vs">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</frag>

    <frag id="20003031" type="vs">Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</frag>
    <frag id="20003032" type="vs">For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</frag>
    <frag id="20003033" type="vs">The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</frag>
    <frag id="20003034" type="vs">Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</frag>
