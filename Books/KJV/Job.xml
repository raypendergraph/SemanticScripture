    <chapter id="18001">
      <block id="18001001" type="v">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</block>
      <block id="18001002" type="v">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</block>
      <block id="18001003" type="v">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</block>
      <block id="18001004" type="v">And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</block>
      <block id="18001005" type="v">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</block>
      <block id="18001006" type="v">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</block>
      <block id="18001007" type="v">And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</block>
      <block id="18001008" type="v">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</block>
      <block id="18001009" type="v">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</block>
      <block id="18001010" type="v">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</block>
      <block id="18001011" type="v">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</block>
      <block id="18001012" type="v">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</block>
      <block id="18001013" type="v">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</block>
      <block id="18001014" type="v">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</block>
      <block id="18001015" type="v">And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</block>
      <block id="18001016" type="v">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</block>
      <block id="18001017" type="v">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</block>
      <block id="18001018" type="v">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</block>
      <block id="18001019" type="v">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</block>
      <block id="18001020" type="v">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</block>
      <block id="18001021" type="v">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</block>
      <block id="18001022" type="v">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18002">
      <block id="18002001" type="v">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</block>
      <block id="18002002" type="v">And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</block>
      <block id="18002003" type="v">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</block>
      <block id="18002004" type="v">And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</block>
      <block id="18002005" type="v">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</block>
      <block id="18002006" type="v">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</block>
      <block id="18002007" type="v">So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</block>
      <block id="18002008" type="v">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</block>
      <block id="18002009" type="v">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</block>
      <block id="18002010" type="v">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</block>
      <block id="18002011" type="v">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</block>
      <block id="18002012" type="v">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</block>
      <block id="18002013" type="v">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18003">
      <block id="18003001" type="v">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</block>
      <block id="18003002" type="v">And Job spake, and said,</block>
      <block id="18003003" type="v">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</block>
      <block id="18003004" type="v">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</block>
      <block id="18003005" type="v">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</block>
      <block id="18003006" type="v">As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</block>
      <block id="18003007" type="v">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</block>
      <block id="18003008" type="v">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</block>
      <block id="18003009" type="v">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</block>
      <block id="18003010" type="v">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</block>
      <block id="18003011" type="v">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</block>
      <block id="18003012" type="v">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</block>
      <block id="18003013" type="v">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</block>
      <block id="18003014" type="v">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</block>
      <block id="18003015" type="v">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</block>
      <block id="18003016" type="v">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</block>
      <block id="18003017" type="v">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</block>
      <block id="18003018" type="v">There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</block>
      <block id="18003019" type="v">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</block>
      <block id="18003020" type="v">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</block>
      <block id="18003021" type="v">Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</block>
      <block id="18003022" type="v">Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</block>
      <block id="18003023" type="v">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</block>
      <block id="18003024" type="v">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</block>
      <block id="18003025" type="v">For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</block>
      <block id="18003026" type="v">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18004">
      <block id="18004001" type="v">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</block>
      <block id="18004002" type="v">If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</block>
      <block id="18004003" type="v">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</block>
      <block id="18004004" type="v">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</block>
      <block id="18004005" type="v">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</block>
      <block id="18004006" type="v">Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</block>
      <block id="18004007" type="v">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</block>
      <block id="18004008" type="v">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</block>
      <block id="18004009" type="v">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</block>
      <block id="18004010" type="v">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</block>
      <block id="18004011" type="v">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</block>
      <block id="18004012" type="v">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</block>
      <block id="18004013" type="v">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</block>
      <block id="18004014" type="v">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</block>
      <block id="18004015" type="v">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</block>
      <block id="18004016" type="v">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</block>
      <block id="18004017" type="v">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</block>
      <block id="18004018" type="v">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</block>
      <block id="18004019" type="v">How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</block>
      <block id="18004020" type="v">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</block>
      <block id="18004021" type="v">Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18005">
      <block id="18005001" type="v">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</block>
      <block id="18005002" type="v">For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</block>
      <block id="18005003" type="v">I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</block>
      <block id="18005004" type="v">His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</block>
      <block id="18005005" type="v">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</block>
      <block id="18005006" type="v">Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</block>
      <block id="18005007" type="v">Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</block>
      <block id="18005008" type="v">I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</block>
      <block id="18005009" type="v">Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</block>
      <block id="18005010" type="v">Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</block>
      <block id="18005011" type="v">To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</block>
      <block id="18005012" type="v">He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</block>
      <block id="18005013" type="v">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</block>
      <block id="18005014" type="v">They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</block>
      <block id="18005015" type="v">But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</block>
      <block id="18005016" type="v">So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</block>
      <block id="18005017" type="v">Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</block>
      <block id="18005018" type="v">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</block>
      <block id="18005019" type="v">He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</block>
      <block id="18005020" type="v">In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</block>
      <block id="18005021" type="v">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</block>
      <block id="18005022" type="v">At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</block>
      <block id="18005023" type="v">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</block>
      <block id="18005024" type="v">And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</block>
      <block id="18005025" type="v">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</block>
      <block id="18005026" type="v">Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</block>
      <block id="18005027" type="v">Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18006">
      <block id="18006001" type="v">But Job answered and said,</block>
      <block id="18006002" type="v">Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</block>
      <block id="18006003" type="v">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</block>
      <block id="18006004" type="v">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</block>
      <block id="18006005" type="v">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</block>
      <block id="18006006" type="v">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</block>
      <block id="18006007" type="v">The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</block>
      <block id="18006008" type="v">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</block>
      <block id="18006009" type="v">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</block>
      <block id="18006010" type="v">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</block>
      <block id="18006011" type="v">What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</block>
      <block id="18006012" type="v">Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</block>
      <block id="18006013" type="v">Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</block>
      <block id="18006014" type="v">To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</block>
      <block id="18006015" type="v">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</block>
      <block id="18006016" type="v">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</block>
      <block id="18006017" type="v">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</block>
      <block id="18006018" type="v">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</block>
      <block id="18006019" type="v">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</block>
      <block id="18006020" type="v">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</block>
      <block id="18006021" type="v">For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</block>
      <block id="18006022" type="v">Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</block>
      <block id="18006023" type="v">Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</block>
      <block id="18006024" type="v">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</block>
      <block id="18006025" type="v">How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</block>
      <block id="18006026" type="v">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</block>
      <block id="18006027" type="v">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</block>
      <block id="18006028" type="v">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</block>
      <block id="18006029" type="v">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</block>
      <block id="18006030" type="v">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18007">
      <block id="18007001" type="v">Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</block>
      <block id="18007002" type="v">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</block>
      <block id="18007003" type="v">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</block>
      <block id="18007004" type="v">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</block>
      <block id="18007005" type="v">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</block>
      <block id="18007006" type="v">My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</block>
      <block id="18007007" type="v">O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</block>
      <block id="18007008" type="v">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</block>
      <block id="18007009" type="v">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</block>
      <block id="18007010" type="v">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</block>
      <block id="18007011" type="v">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</block>
      <block id="18007012" type="v">Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</block>
      <block id="18007013" type="v">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</block>
      <block id="18007014" type="v">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</block>
      <block id="18007015" type="v">So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</block>
      <block id="18007016" type="v">I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</block>
      <block id="18007017" type="v">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</block>
      <block id="18007018" type="v">And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</block>
      <block id="18007019" type="v">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</block>
      <block id="18007020" type="v">I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</block>
      <block id="18007021" type="v">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</block>

      <block id="18008001" type="v">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</block>
      <block id="18008002" type="v">How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</block>
      <block id="18008003" type="v">Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</block>
      <block id="18008004" type="v">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</block>
      <block id="18008005" type="v">If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</block>
      <block id="18008006" type="v">If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</block>
      <block id="18008007" type="v">Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</block>
      <block id="18008008" type="v">For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</block>
      <block id="18008009" type="v">(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</block>
      <block id="18008010" type="v">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</block>
      <block id="18008011" type="v">Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</block>
      <block id="18008012" type="v">Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</block>
      <block id="18008013" type="v">So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</block>
      <block id="18008014" type="v">Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</block>
      <block id="18008015" type="v">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</block>
      <block id="18008016" type="v">He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</block>
      <block id="18008017" type="v">His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</block>
      <block id="18008018" type="v">If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</block>
      <block id="18008019" type="v">Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</block>
      <block id="18008020" type="v">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</block>
      <block id="18008021" type="v">Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</block>
      <block id="18008022" type="v">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</block>

    <chapter id="18009">
      <block id="18009001" type="v">Then Job answered and said,</block>
      <block id="18009002" type="v">I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</block>
      <block id="18009003" type="v">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</block>
      <block id="18009004" type="v">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</block>
      <block id="18009005" type="v">Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</block>
      <block id="18009006" type="v">Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</block>
      <block id="18009007" type="v">Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</block>
      <block id="18009008" type="v">Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</block>
      <block id="18009009" type="v">Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</block>
      <block id="18009010" type="v">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</block>
      <block id="18009011" type="v">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</block>
      <block id="18009012" type="v">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</block>
      <block id="18009013" type="v">If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</block>
      <block id="18009014" type="v">How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</block>
      <block id="18009015" type="v">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</block>
      <block id="18009016" type="v">If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</block>
      <block id="18009017" type="v">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</block>
      <block id="18009018" type="v">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</block>
      <block id="18009019" type="v">If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</block>
      <block id="18009020" type="v">If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</block>
      <block id="18009021" type="v">Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</block>
      <block id="18009022" type="v">This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</block>
      <block id="18009023" type="v">If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</block>
      <block id="18009024" type="v">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</block>
      <block id="18009025" type="v">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</block>
      <block id="18009026" type="v">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</block>
      <block id="18009027" type="v">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</block>
      <block id="18009028" type="v">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</block>
      <block id="18009029" type="v">If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</block>
      <block id="18009030" type="v">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</block>
      <block id="18009031" type="v">Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</block>
      <block id="18009032" type="v">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</block>
      <block id="18009033" type="v">Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</block>
      <block id="18009034" type="v">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</block>
      <block id="18009035" type="v">Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18010">
      <block id="18010001" type="v">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</block>
      <block id="18010002" type="v">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</block>
      <block id="18010003" type="v">Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</block>
      <block id="18010004" type="v">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</block>
      <block id="18010005" type="v">Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,</block>
      <block id="18010006" type="v">That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</block>
      <block id="18010007" type="v">Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.</block>
      <block id="18010008" type="v">Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</block>
      <block id="18010009" type="v">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</block>
      <block id="18010010" type="v">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</block>
      <block id="18010011" type="v">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</block>
      <block id="18010012" type="v">Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</block>
      <block id="18010013" type="v">And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.</block>
      <block id="18010014" type="v">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</block>
      <block id="18010015" type="v">If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</block>
      <block id="18010016" type="v">For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</block>
      <block id="18010017" type="v">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</block>
      <block id="18010018" type="v">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</block>
      <block id="18010019" type="v">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</block>
      <block id="18010020" type="v">Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</block>
      <block id="18010021" type="v">Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</block>
      <block id="18010022" type="v">A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18011">
      <block id="18011001" type="v">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</block>
      <block id="18011002" type="v">Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</block>
      <block id="18011003" type="v">Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</block>
      <block id="18011004" type="v">For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</block>
      <block id="18011005" type="v">But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</block>
      <block id="18011006" type="v">And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</block>
      <block id="18011007" type="v">Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</block>
      <block id="18011008" type="v">It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</block>
      <block id="18011009" type="v">The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</block>
      <block id="18011010" type="v">If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</block>
      <block id="18011011" type="v">For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</block>
      <block id="18011012" type="v">For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.</block>
      <block id="18011013" type="v">If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</block>
      <block id="18011014" type="v">If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</block>
      <block id="18011015" type="v">For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</block>
      <block id="18011016" type="v">Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</block>
      <block id="18011017" type="v">And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</block>
      <block id="18011018" type="v">And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</block>
      <block id="18011019" type="v">Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</block>
      <block id="18011020" type="v">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18012">
      <block id="18012001" type="v">And Job answered and said,</block>
      <block id="18012002" type="v">No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</block>
      <block id="18012003" type="v">But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</block>
      <block id="18012004" type="v">I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</block>
      <block id="18012005" type="v">He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</block>
      <block id="18012006" type="v">The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</block>
      <block id="18012007" type="v">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</block>
      <block id="18012008" type="v">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</block>
      <block id="18012009" type="v">Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</block>
      <block id="18012010" type="v">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</block>
      <block id="18012011" type="v">Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</block>
      <block id="18012012" type="v">With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</block>
      <block id="18012013" type="v">With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</block>
      <block id="18012014" type="v">Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</block>
      <block id="18012015" type="v">Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</block>
      <block id="18012016" type="v">With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.</block>
      <block id="18012017" type="v">He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</block>
      <block id="18012018" type="v">He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</block>
      <block id="18012019" type="v">He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</block>
      <block id="18012020" type="v">He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</block>
      <block id="18012021" type="v">He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</block>
      <block id="18012022" type="v">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</block>
      <block id="18012023" type="v">He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.</block>
      <block id="18012024" type="v">He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</block>
      <block id="18012025" type="v">They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</block>

      <block id="18013024" type="v">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</block>
      <block id="18013025" type="v">Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</block>
      <block id="18013026" type="v">For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</block>
      <block id="18013027" type="v">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</block>

      <block id="18015004" type="v">Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</block>

      <block id="18015033" type="v">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</block>
      <block id="18015034" type="v">For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</block>

      <block id="18029016" type="v">I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</block>
      <block id="18029017" type="v">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</block>
      <block id="18029018" type="v">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</block>
      <block id="18029019" type="v">My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</block>
      <block id="18029020" type="v">My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</block>
      <block id="18029021" type="v">Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</block>
      <block id="18029022" type="v">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</block>
      <block id="18029023" type="v">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</block>
      <block id="18029024" type="v">If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</block>
      <block id="18029025" type="v">I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</block>

      <block id="18030001" type="v">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</block>

      <block id="18030003" type="v">For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</block>
      <block id="18030004" type="v">Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.</block>
      <block id="18030005" type="v">They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)</block>
      <block id="18030006" type="v">To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</block>
      <block id="18030007" type="v">Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</block>
      <block id="18030008" type="v">They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</block>
      <block id="18030009" type="v">And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</block>
      <block id="18030010" type="v">They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</block>
      <block id="18030011" type="v">Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</block>

      <block id="18030014" type="v">They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</block>
      <block id="18030015" type="v">Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</block>
      <block id="18030016" type="v">And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</block>

      <block id="18030018" type="v">By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</block>
      <block id="18030019" type="v">He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</block>
      <block id="18030020" type="v">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</block>

      <block id="18030022" type="v">Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</block>
      <block id="18030023" type="v">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</block>
      <block id="18030024" type="v">Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</block>
      <block id="18030025" type="v">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</block>
      <block id="18030026" type="v">When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</block>
      <block id="18030027" type="v">My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</block>
      <block id="18030028" type="v">I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</block>
      <block id="18030029" type="v">I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</block>

    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18032">
      <block id="18032001" type="v">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</block>
      <block id="18032002" type="v">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</block>
      <block id="18032003" type="v">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</block>
      <block id="18032004" type="v">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</block>
      <block id="18032005" type="v">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</block>
      <block id="18032006" type="v">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</block>
      <block id="18032007" type="v">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</block>
      <block id="18032008" type="v">But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</block>
      <block id="18032009" type="v">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</block>
      <block id="18032010" type="v">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</block>
      <block id="18032011" type="v">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</block>
      <block id="18032012" type="v">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</block>
      <block id="18032013" type="v">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</block>
      <block id="18032014" type="v">Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</block>
      <block id="18032015" type="v">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</block>
      <block id="18032016" type="v">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</block>
      <block id="18032017" type="v">I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</block>
      <block id="18032018" type="v">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</block>
      <block id="18032019" type="v">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</block>
      <block id="18032020" type="v">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</block>
      <block id="18032021" type="v">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</block>
      <block id="18032022" type="v">For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18033">
      <block id="18033001" type="v">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</block>
      <block id="18033002" type="v">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</block>
      <block id="18033003" type="v">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</block>
      <block id="18033004" type="v">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</block>
      <block id="18033005" type="v">If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</block>
      <block id="18033006" type="v">Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</block>
      <block id="18033007" type="v">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</block>
      <block id="18033008" type="v">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</block>
      <block id="18033009" type="v">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</block>
      <block id="18033010" type="v">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</block>
      <block id="18033011" type="v">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</block>
      <block id="18033012" type="v">Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</block>
      <block id="18033013" type="v">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</block>
      <block id="18033014" type="v">For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</block>
      <block id="18033015" type="v">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</block>
      <block id="18033016" type="v">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</block>
      <block id="18033017" type="v">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</block>
      <block id="18033018" type="v">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</block>
      <block id="18033019" type="v">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</block>
      <block id="18033020" type="v">So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</block>
      <block id="18033021" type="v">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</block>
      <block id="18033022" type="v">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</block>
      <block id="18033023" type="v">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</block>
      <block id="18033024" type="v">Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</block>
      <block id="18033025" type="v">His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</block>
      <block id="18033026" type="v">He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</block>
      <block id="18033027" type="v">He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</block>
      <block id="18033028" type="v">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</block>
      <block id="18033029" type="v">Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</block>
      <block id="18033030" type="v">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</block>
      <block id="18033031" type="v">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</block>
      <block id="18033032" type="v">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</block>
      <block id="18033033" type="v">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18034">
      <block id="18034001" type="v">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</block>

      <block id="18034003" type="v">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</block>
      <block id="18034004" type="v">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</block>
      <block id="18034005" type="v">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</block>
      <block id="18034006" type="v">Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</block>
      <block id="18034007" type="v">What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</block>
      <block id="18034008" type="v">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</block>
      <block id="18034009" type="v">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</block>
      <block id="18034010" type="v">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</block>
      <block id="18034011" type="v">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</block>
      <block id="18034012" type="v">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</block>
      <block id="18034013" type="v">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</block>
      <block id="18034014" type="v">If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</block>
      <block id="18034015" type="v">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</block>
      <block id="18034016" type="v">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</block>
      <block id="18034017" type="v">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</block>
      <block id="18034018" type="v">Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</block>
      <block id="18034019" type="v">How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</block>
      <block id="18034020" type="v">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</block>
      <block id="18034021" type="v">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</block>
      <block id="18034022" type="v">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</block>
      <block id="18034023" type="v">For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</block>
      <block id="18034024" type="v">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</block>
      <block id="18034025" type="v">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</block>
      <block id="18034026" type="v">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</block>
      <block id="18034027" type="v">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</block>
      <block id="18034028" type="v">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</block>
      <block id="18034029" type="v">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</block>
      <block id="18034030" type="v">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</block>
      <block id="18034031" type="v">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</block>
      <block id="18034032" type="v">That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</block>
      <block id="18034033" type="v">Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</block>
      <block id="18034034" type="v">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</block>
      <block id="18034035" type="v">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</block>
      <block id="18034036" type="v">My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</block>
      <block id="18034037" type="v">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</block>

      <block id="18035001" type="v">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</block>
      <block id="18035002" type="v">Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</block>
      <block id="18035003" type="v">For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</block>
      <block id="18035004" type="v">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</block>
      <block id="18035005" type="v">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</block>
      <block id="18035006" type="v">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</block>
      <block id="18035007" type="v">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</block>
      <block id="18035008" type="v">Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</block>
      <block id="18035009" type="v">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</block>
      <block id="18035010" type="v">But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</block>
      <block id="18035011" type="v">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</block>
      <block id="18035012" type="v">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</block>
      <block id="18035013" type="v">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</block>
      <block id="18035014" type="v">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</block>
      <block id="18035015" type="v">But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</block>
      <block id="18035016" type="v">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="18036">
      <block id="18036001" type="v">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</block>
      <block id="18036002" type="v">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</block>
      <block id="18036003" type="v">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</block>
      <block id="18036004" type="v">For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</block>
      <block id="18036005" type="v">Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</block>
      <block id="18036006" type="v">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</block>
      <block id="18036007" type="v">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</block>
      <block id="18036008" type="v">And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</block>
      <block id="18036009" type="v">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</block>
      <block id="18036010" type="v">He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</block>
      <block id="18036011" type="v">If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</block>
      <block id="18036012" type="v">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</block>
      <block id="18036013" type="v">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</block>
      <block id="18036014" type="v">They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</block>
      <block id="18036015" type="v">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</block>
      <block id="18036016" type="v">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</block>
      <block id="18036017" type="v">But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</block>
      <block id="18036018" type="v">Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</block>
      <block id="18036019" type="v">Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</block>
      <block id="18036020" type="v">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</block>
      <block id="18036021" type="v">Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</block>
      <block id="18036022" type="v">Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</block>
      <block id="18036023" type="v">Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</block>
      <block id="18036024" type="v">Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</block>
      <block id="18036025" type="v">Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</block>
      <block id="18036026" type="v">Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</block>
      <block id="18036027" type="v">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</block>
      <block id="18036028" type="v">Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</block>
      <block id="18036029" type="v">Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</block>
      <block id="18036030" type="v">Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</block>
      <block id="18036031" type="v">For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</block>
      <block id="18036032" type="v">With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</block>

      <block id="18037013" type="v">He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</block>
      <block id="18037014" type="v">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</block>

      <block id="18037016" type="v">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</block>
      <block id="18037017" type="v">How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</block>
      <block id="18037018" type="v">Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</block>
      <block id="18037019" type="v">Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</block>

      <block id="18041006" type="v">Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</block>
      <block id="18041007" type="v">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</block>
      <block id="18041008" type="v">Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</block>
      <block id="18041009" type="v">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</block>
      <block id="18041010" type="v">None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</block>
      <block id="18041011" type="v">Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</block>
      <block id="18041012" type="v">I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</block>
      <block id="18041013" type="v">Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?</block>
      <block id="18041014" type="v">Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</block>
      <block id="18041015" type="v">His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</block>
      <block id="18041016" type="v">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</block>
      <block id="18041017" type="v">They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</block>
      <block id="18041018" type="v">By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</block>
      <block id="18041019" type="v">Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</block>
      <block id="18041020" type="v">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</block>
      <block id="18041021" type="v">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</block>
      <block id="18041022" type="v">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</block>
      <block id="18041023" type="v">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</block>
      <block id="18041024" type="v">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</block>
      <block id="18041025" type="v">When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</block>
      <block id="18041026" type="v">The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</block>
      <block id="18041027" type="v">He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</block>
      <block id="18041028" type="v">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</block>
      <block id="18041029" type="v">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</block>
      <block id="18041030" type="v">Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</block>
      <block id="18041031" type="v">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</block>
      <block id="18041032" type="v">He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</block>
      <block id="18041033" type="v">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</block>
      <block id="18041034" type="v">He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</block>

    <chapter id="18042">
      <block id="18042001" type="v">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</block>
      <block id="18042002" type="v">I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</block>
      <block id="18042003" type="v">Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</block>
      <block id="18042004" type="v">Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</block>
      <block id="18042005" type="v">I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</block>
      <block id="18042006" type="v">Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</block>
      <block id="18042007" type="v">And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</block>
      <block id="18042008" type="v">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</block>
      <block id="18042009" type="v">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</block>
      <block id="18042010" type="v">And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</block>
      <block id="18042011" type="v">Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</block>
      <block id="18042012" type="v">So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</block>
      <block id="18042013" type="v">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</block>
      <block id="18042014" type="v">And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</block>
      <block id="18042015" type="v">And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</block>
      <block id="18042016" type="v">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</block>
      <block id="18042017" type="v">So Job died, being old and full of days.</block>
