        <fragment id="49001003" kind="vs">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</fragment>
        <fragment id="49001004" kind="vs">According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</fragment>
        <fragment id="49001005" kind="vs">Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</fragment>

        <fragment id="49001009" kind="vs">Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</fragment>
        <fragment id="49001010" kind="vs">That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:</fragment>
        <fragment id="49001011" kind="vs">In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</fragment>

        <fragment id="49001013" kind="vs">In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</fragment>
        <fragment id="49001014" kind="vs">Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</fragment>
        <fragment id="49001015" kind="vs">Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,</fragment>

        <fragment id="49002011" kind="vs">Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;</fragment>

        <fragment id="49002014" kind="vs">For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;</fragment>
        <fragment id="49002015" kind="vs">Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;</fragment>
        <fragment id="49002016" kind="vs">And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</fragment>
        <fragment id="49002017" kind="vs">And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</fragment>
        <fragment id="49002018" kind="vs">For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</fragment>
        <fragment id="49002019" kind="vs">Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;</fragment>
        <fragment id="49002020" kind="vs">And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</fragment>

        <fragment id="49004025" kind="vs">Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.</fragment>

        <fragment id="49005023" kind="vs">For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</fragment>

        <fragment id="49005031" kind="vs">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</fragment>
