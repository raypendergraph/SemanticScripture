    <frag id="28001001" type="vs">The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="28001002" type="vs">The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="28001003" type="vs">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</frag>
    <frag id="28001004" type="vs">And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="28001005" type="vs">And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</frag>
    <frag id="28001006" type="vs">And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</frag>
    <frag id="28001007" type="vs">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</frag>
    <frag id="28001008" type="vs">Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</frag>
    <frag id="28001009" type="vs">Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.</frag>
    <frag id="28001010" type="vs">Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.</frag>
    <frag id="28001011" type="vs">Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</frag>

    <frag id="28002002" type="vs">Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</frag>
    <frag id="28002003" type="vs">Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</frag>
    <frag id="28002004" type="vs">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.</frag>
    <frag id="28002005" type="vs">For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</frag>
    <frag id="28002006" type="vs">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</frag>
    <frag id="28002007" type="vs">And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</frag>
    <frag id="28002008" type="vs">For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</frag>
    <frag id="28002009" type="vs">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.</frag>
    <frag id="28002010" type="vs">And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</frag>
    <frag id="28002011" type="vs">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</frag>
    <frag id="28002012" type="vs">And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</frag>
    <frag id="28002013" type="vs">And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="28002014" type="vs">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</frag>
    <frag id="28002015" type="vs">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</frag>
    <frag id="28002016" type="vs">And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</frag>
    <frag id="28002017" type="vs">For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</frag>
    <frag id="28002018" type="vs">And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</frag>
    <frag id="28002019" type="vs">And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</frag>
    <frag id="28002020" type="vs">I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="28002021" type="vs">And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</frag>
    <frag id="28002022" type="vs">And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</frag>
    <frag id="28002023" type="vs">And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.</frag>

    <frag id="28004013" type="vs">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</frag>
    <frag id="28004014" type="vs">I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</frag>
