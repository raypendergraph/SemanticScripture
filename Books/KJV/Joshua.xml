        <fragment id="6001001" kind="vs">Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001002" kind="vs">Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001003" kind="vs">Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001004" kind="vs">From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001005" kind="vs">There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001006" kind="vs">Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001007" kind="vs">Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001008" kind="vs">This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001009" kind="vs">Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001010" kind="vs">Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001011" kind="vs">Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001012" kind="vs">And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001013" kind="vs">Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001014" kind="vs">Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001015" kind="vs">Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001016" kind="vs">And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001017" kind="vs">According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6001018" kind="vs">Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</fragment>

        <fragment id="6002001" kind="vs">And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002002" kind="vs">And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002003" kind="vs">And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002004" kind="vs">And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002005" kind="vs">And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002006" kind="vs">But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002007" kind="vs">And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002008" kind="vs">And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002009" kind="vs">And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002010" kind="vs">For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002011" kind="vs">And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002012" kind="vs">Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002013" kind="vs">And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002014" kind="vs">And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002015" kind="vs">Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002016" kind="vs">And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002017" kind="vs">And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002018" kind="vs">Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002019" kind="vs">And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002020" kind="vs">And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002021" kind="vs">And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002022" kind="vs">And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002023" kind="vs">So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</fragment>
        <fragment id="6002024" kind="vs">And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</fragment>

        <fragment id="6005004" kind="vs">And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</fragment>
