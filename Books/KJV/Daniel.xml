    <frag id="27001001" type="vs">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</frag>
    <frag id="27001002" type="vs">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</frag>
    <frag id="27001003" type="vs">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</frag>
    <frag id="27001004" type="vs">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</frag>
    <frag id="27001005" type="vs">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</frag>
    <frag id="27001006" type="vs">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</frag>
    <frag id="27001007" type="vs">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</frag>
    <frag id="27001008" type="vs">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</frag>
    <frag id="27001009" type="vs">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</frag>
    <frag id="27001010" type="vs">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</frag>
    <frag id="27001011" type="vs">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</frag>
    <frag id="27001012" type="vs">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</frag>
    <frag id="27001013" type="vs">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</frag>
    <frag id="27001014" type="vs">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</frag>
    <frag id="27001015" type="vs">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</frag>
    <frag id="27001016" type="vs">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</frag>
    <frag id="27001017" type="vs">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</frag>
    <frag id="27001018" type="vs">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</frag>
    <frag id="27001019" type="vs">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</frag>
    <frag id="27001020" type="vs">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</frag>
    <frag id="27001021" type="vs">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="27002">
    <frag id="27002001" type="vs">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</frag>
    <frag id="27002002" type="vs">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</frag>
    <frag id="27002003" type="vs">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</frag>
    <frag id="27002004" type="vs">Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</frag>
    <frag id="27002005" type="vs">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</frag>
    <frag id="27002006" type="vs">But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</frag>
    <frag id="27002007" type="vs">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</frag>
    <frag id="27002008" type="vs">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</frag>
    <frag id="27002009" type="vs">But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</frag>
    <frag id="27002010" type="vs">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</frag>
    <frag id="27002011" type="vs">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</frag>
    <frag id="27002012" type="vs">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="27002013" type="vs">And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</frag>
    <frag id="27002014" type="vs">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</frag>
    <frag id="27002015" type="vs">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</frag>
    <frag id="27002016" type="vs">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</frag>
    <frag id="27002017" type="vs">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</frag>
    <frag id="27002018" type="vs">That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="27002019" type="vs">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</frag>
    <frag id="27002020" type="vs">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</frag>
    <frag id="27002021" type="vs">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</frag>
    <frag id="27002022" type="vs">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</frag>
    <frag id="27002023" type="vs">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.</frag>
    <frag id="27002024" type="vs">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</frag>
    <frag id="27002025" type="vs">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</frag>
    <frag id="27002026" type="vs">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</frag>
    <frag id="27002027" type="vs">Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</frag>
    <frag id="27002028" type="vs">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</frag>
    <frag id="27002029" type="vs">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</frag>
    <frag id="27002030" type="vs">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</frag>
    <frag id="27002031" type="vs">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</frag>
    <frag id="27002032" type="vs">This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</frag>
    <frag id="27002033" type="vs">His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</frag>
    <frag id="27002034" type="vs">Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</frag>
    <frag id="27002035" type="vs">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</frag>
    <frag id="27002036" type="vs">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</frag>
    <frag id="27002037" type="vs">Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</frag>
    <frag id="27002038" type="vs">And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</frag>
    <frag id="27002039" type="vs">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</frag>
    <frag id="27002040" type="vs">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</frag>
    <frag id="27002041" type="vs">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</frag>
    <frag id="27002042" type="vs">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</frag>
    <frag id="27002043" type="vs">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</frag>
    <frag id="27002044" type="vs">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="27002045" type="vs">Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</frag>
    <frag id="27002046" type="vs">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</frag>
    <frag id="27002047" type="vs">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</frag>
    <frag id="27002048" type="vs">Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="27002049" type="vs">Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="27003">
    <frag id="27003001" type="vs">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</frag>
    <frag id="27003002" type="vs">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</frag>
    <frag id="27003003" type="vs">Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</frag>
    <frag id="27003004" type="vs">Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</frag>
    <frag id="27003005" type="vs">That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:</frag>
    <frag id="27003006" type="vs">And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</frag>
    <frag id="27003007" type="vs">Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</frag>
    <frag id="27003008" type="vs">Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</frag>
    <frag id="27003009" type="vs">They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="27003010" type="vs">Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</frag>
    <frag id="27003011" type="vs">And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</frag>
    <frag id="27003012" type="vs">There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</frag>
    <frag id="27003013" type="vs">Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</frag>
    <frag id="27003014" type="vs">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</frag>
    <frag id="27003015" type="vs">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</frag>
    <frag id="27003016" type="vs">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</frag>
    <frag id="27003017" type="vs">If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</frag>
    <frag id="27003018" type="vs">But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</frag>
    <frag id="27003019" type="vs">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</frag>
    <frag id="27003020" type="vs">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</frag>
    <frag id="27003021" type="vs">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</frag>
    <frag id="27003022" type="vs">Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</frag>
    <frag id="27003023" type="vs">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</frag>
    <frag id="27003024" type="vs">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</frag>
    <frag id="27003025" type="vs">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</frag>
    <frag id="27003026" type="vs">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</frag>
    <frag id="27003027" type="vs">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</frag>
    <frag id="27003028" type="vs">Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</frag>
    <frag id="27003029" type="vs">Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</frag>
    <frag id="27003030" type="vs">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="27004">
    <frag id="27004001" type="vs">Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</frag>
    <frag id="27004002" type="vs">I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</frag>
    <frag id="27004003" type="vs">How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</frag>
    <frag id="27004004" type="vs">I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:</frag>
    <frag id="27004005" type="vs">I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</frag>
    <frag id="27004006" type="vs">Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</frag>
    <frag id="27004007" type="vs">Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</frag>
    <frag id="27004008" type="vs">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</frag>
    <frag id="27004009" type="vs">O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</frag>
    <frag id="27004010" type="vs">Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</frag>
    <frag id="27004011" type="vs">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</frag>
    <frag id="27004012" type="vs">The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</frag>
    <frag id="27004013" type="vs">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</frag>
    <frag id="27004014" type="vs">He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:</frag>
    <frag id="27004015" type="vs">Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</frag>
    <frag id="27004016" type="vs">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</frag>
    <frag id="27004017" type="vs">This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</frag>
    <frag id="27004018" type="vs">This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</frag>
    <frag id="27004019" type="vs">Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</frag>
    <frag id="27004020" type="vs">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</frag>
    <frag id="27004021" type="vs">Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</frag>
    <frag id="27004022" type="vs">It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</frag>
    <frag id="27004023" type="vs">And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</frag>
    <frag id="27004024" type="vs">This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</frag>
    <frag id="27004025" type="vs">That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</frag>
    <frag id="27004026" type="vs">And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</frag>
    <frag id="27004027" type="vs">Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</frag>

    <frag id="27004030" type="vs">The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</frag>
    <frag id="27004031" type="vs">While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</frag>
    <frag id="27004032" type="vs">And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</frag>
    <frag id="27004033" type="vs">The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</frag>
    <frag id="27004034" type="vs">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</frag>
    <frag id="27004035" type="vs">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</frag>
    <frag id="27004036" type="vs">At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</frag>
    <frag id="27004037" type="vs">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</frag>

    <frag id="27005012" type="vs">Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</frag>
    <frag id="27005013" type="vs">Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?</frag>

    <frag id="27005017" type="vs">Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</frag>

    <frag id="27005024" type="vs">Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</frag>

    <frag id="27006003" type="vs">Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</frag>
    <frag id="27006004" type="vs">Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</frag>
    <frag id="27006005" type="vs">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</frag>
    <frag id="27006006" type="vs">Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="27006007" type="vs">All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</frag>
    <frag id="27006008" type="vs">Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</frag>
    <frag id="27006009" type="vs">Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</frag>
    <frag id="27006010" type="vs">Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</frag>
    <frag id="27006011" type="vs">Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</frag>
    <frag id="27006012" type="vs">Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</frag>
    <frag id="27006013" type="vs">Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</frag>
    <frag id="27006014" type="vs">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</frag>
    <frag id="27006015" type="vs">Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</frag>
    <frag id="27006016" type="vs">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</frag>
    <frag id="27006017" type="vs">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</frag>
    <frag id="27006018" type="vs">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</frag>
    <frag id="27006019" type="vs">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</frag>
    <frag id="27006020" type="vs">And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</frag>
    <frag id="27006021" type="vs">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="27006022" type="vs">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</frag>
    <frag id="27006023" type="vs">Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</frag>
    <frag id="27006024" type="vs">And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</frag>
    <frag id="27006025" type="vs">Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</frag>
    <frag id="27006026" type="vs">I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</frag>
    <frag id="27006027" type="vs">He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</frag>
    <frag id="27006028" type="vs">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="27007">
    <frag id="27007001" type="vs">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</frag>
    <frag id="27007002" type="vs">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</frag>
    <frag id="27007003" type="vs">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</frag>
    <frag id="27007004" type="vs">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</frag>
    <frag id="27007005" type="vs">And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</frag>
    <frag id="27007006" type="vs">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</frag>
    <frag id="27007007" type="vs">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</frag>
    <frag id="27007008" type="vs">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</frag>
    <frag id="27007009" type="vs">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</frag>
    <frag id="27007010" type="vs">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</frag>
    <frag id="27007011" type="vs">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</frag>
    <frag id="27007012" type="vs">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</frag>
    <frag id="27007013" type="vs">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</frag>
    <frag id="27007014" type="vs">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</frag>
    <frag id="27007015" type="vs">I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</frag>
    <frag id="27007016" type="vs">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</frag>
    <frag id="27007017" type="vs">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</frag>
    <frag id="27007018" type="vs">But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</frag>
    <frag id="27007019" type="vs">Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</frag>
    <frag id="27007020" type="vs">And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</frag>
    <frag id="27007021" type="vs">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</frag>
    <frag id="27007022" type="vs">Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</frag>
    <frag id="27007023" type="vs">Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</frag>
    <frag id="27007024" type="vs">And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</frag>
    <frag id="27007025" type="vs">And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</frag>
    <frag id="27007026" type="vs">But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</frag>
    <frag id="27007027" type="vs">And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</frag>
    <frag id="27007028" type="vs">Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="27008">
    <frag id="27008001" type="vs">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</frag>
    <frag id="27008002" type="vs">And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</frag>
    <frag id="27008003" type="vs">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</frag>
    <frag id="27008004" type="vs">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</frag>
    <frag id="27008005" type="vs">And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</frag>
    <frag id="27008006" type="vs">And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</frag>
    <frag id="27008007" type="vs">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</frag>
    <frag id="27008008" type="vs">Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</frag>
    <frag id="27008009" type="vs">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</frag>
    <frag id="27008010" type="vs">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</frag>
    <frag id="27008011" type="vs">Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</frag>
    <frag id="27008012" type="vs">And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</frag>
    <frag id="27008013" type="vs">Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</frag>
    <frag id="27008014" type="vs">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</frag>
    <frag id="27008015" type="vs">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</frag>
    <frag id="27008016" type="vs">And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</frag>
    <frag id="27008017" type="vs">So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</frag>
    <frag id="27008018" type="vs">Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</frag>
    <frag id="27008019" type="vs">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</frag>
    <frag id="27008020" type="vs">The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</frag>
    <frag id="27008021" type="vs">And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</frag>
    <frag id="27008022" type="vs">Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</frag>
    <frag id="27008023" type="vs">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</frag>
    <frag id="27008024" type="vs">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</frag>
    <frag id="27008025" type="vs">And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</frag>
