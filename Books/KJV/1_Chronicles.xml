    <frag id="13017006" type="vs">Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</frag>
    <frag id="13017007" type="vs">Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</frag>
    <frag id="13017008" type="vs">And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</frag>

    <frag id="13017012" type="vs">He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="13017013" type="vs">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</frag>

    <frag id="13017015" type="vs">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</frag>
    <frag id="13017016" type="vs">And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</frag>
    <frag id="13017017" type="vs">And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</frag>
    <frag id="13017018" type="vs">What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</frag>
    <frag id="13017019" type="vs">O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</frag>

    <frag id="13017021" type="vs">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</frag>
    <frag id="13017022" type="vs">For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</frag>
    <frag id="13017023" type="vs">Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</frag>
    <frag id="13017024" type="vs">Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</frag>
    <frag id="13017025" type="vs">For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</frag>
    <frag id="13017026" type="vs">And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</frag>
    <frag id="13017027" type="vs">Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</frag>

    <frag id="13019003" type="vs">But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</frag>
    <frag id="13019004" type="vs">Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</frag>
    <frag id="13019005" type="vs">Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</frag>

    <frag id="13021013" type="vs">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</frag>

    <frag id="13021018" type="vs">Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</frag>

    <frag id="13021023" type="vs">And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</frag>
    <frag id="13021024" type="vs">And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</frag>

    <frag id="13028006" type="vs">And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</frag>
    <frag id="13028007" type="vs">Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</frag>
    <frag id="13028008" type="vs">Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="13028009" type="vs">And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="13028010" type="vs">Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</frag>
    <frag id="13028011" type="vs">Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</frag>
    <frag id="13028012" type="vs">And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:</frag>
    <frag id="13028013" type="vs">Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="13028014" type="vs">He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</frag>
    <frag id="13028015" type="vs">Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</frag>
    <frag id="13028016" type="vs">And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:</frag>
    <frag id="13028017" type="vs">Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:</frag>
    <frag id="13028018" type="vs">And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="13028019" type="vs">All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</frag>
    <frag id="13028020" type="vs">And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</frag>
    <frag id="13028021" type="vs">And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="13029">
    <frag id="13029001" type="vs">Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.</frag>
    <frag id="13029002" type="vs">Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</frag>
    <frag id="13029003" type="vs">Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</frag>
    <frag id="13029004" type="vs">Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:</frag>
    <frag id="13029005" type="vs">The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?</frag>
    <frag id="13029006" type="vs">Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,</frag>
    <frag id="13029007" type="vs">And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</frag>
    <frag id="13029008" type="vs">And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</frag>
    <frag id="13029009" type="vs">Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</frag>
    <frag id="13029010" type="vs">Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</frag>
    <frag id="13029011" type="vs">Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</frag>
    <frag id="13029012" type="vs">Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</frag>
    <frag id="13029013" type="vs">Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</frag>
    <frag id="13029014" type="vs">But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</frag>
    <frag id="13029015" type="vs">For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.</frag>
    <frag id="13029016" type="vs">O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.</frag>
    <frag id="13029017" type="vs">I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</frag>
    <frag id="13029018" type="vs">O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</frag>
    <frag id="13029019" type="vs">And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</frag>
    <frag id="13029020" type="vs">And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</frag>
    <frag id="13029021" type="vs">And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</frag>
    <frag id="13029022" type="vs">And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</frag>
    <frag id="13029023" type="vs">Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</frag>
    <frag id="13029024" type="vs">And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</frag>
    <frag id="13029025" type="vs">And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="13029026" type="vs">Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</frag>
    <frag id="13029027" type="vs">And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="13029028" type="vs">And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</frag>
    <frag id="13029029" type="vs">Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</frag>
    <frag id="13029030" type="vs">With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</frag>
