        <ab id="13011024" type="verse">These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</ab>

        <ab id="13017002" type="verse">Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</ab>
        <ab id="13017003" type="verse">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</ab>

        <ab id="13017005" type="verse">For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</ab>
        <ab id="13017006" type="verse">Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</ab>
        <ab id="13017007" type="verse">Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</ab>
        <ab id="13017008" type="verse">And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</ab>

        <ab id="13017013" type="verse">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</ab>

        <ab id="13017015" type="verse">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</ab>
        <ab id="13017016" type="verse">And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</ab>
        <ab id="13017017" type="verse">And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</ab>
        <ab id="13017018" type="verse">What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</ab>
        <ab id="13017019" type="verse">O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</ab>
        <ab id="13017020" type="verse">O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</ab>
        <ab id="13017021" type="verse">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</ab>
        <ab id="13017022" type="verse">For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</ab>
        <ab id="13017023" type="verse">Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</ab>
        <ab id="13017024" type="verse">Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</ab>
        <ab id="13017025" type="verse">For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</ab>
        <ab id="13017026" type="verse">And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</ab>
        <ab id="13017027" type="verse">Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</ab>

        <ab id="13021013" type="verse">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</ab>
        <ab id="13021014" type="verse">So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</ab>
        <ab id="13021015" type="verse">And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</ab>
        <ab id="13021016" type="verse">And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</ab>
        <ab id="13021017" type="verse">And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</ab>
        <ab id="13021018" type="verse">Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</ab>
        <ab id="13021019" type="verse">And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</ab>
        <ab id="13021020" type="verse">And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</ab>
        <ab id="13021021" type="verse">And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</ab>
        <ab id="13021022" type="verse">Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</ab>
        <ab id="13021023" type="verse">And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</ab>
        <ab id="13021024" type="verse">And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</ab>
        <ab id="13021025" type="verse">So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</ab>
        <ab id="13021026" type="verse">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</ab>
        <ab id="13021027" type="verse">And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</ab>
        <ab id="13021028" type="verse">At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</ab>
        <ab id="13021029" type="verse">For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</ab>
        <ab id="13021030" type="verse">But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</ab>

        <ab id="13022009" type="verse">Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</ab>

        <ab id="13022017" type="verse">David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</ab>
