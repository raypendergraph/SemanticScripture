      Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the
      son of Amon, king of Judah.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001002" kind="vs">I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the
      LORD.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001003" kind="vs">I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
      heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off
      man from off the land, saith the LORD.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001004" kind="vs">I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name
      of the Chemarims with the priests;</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001005" kind="vs">And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
      and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;</fragment>

      have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001007" kind="vs">Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of
      the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001008" kind="vs">And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice,

      strange apparel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001009" kind="vs">In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
      threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001010" kind="vs">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that
      there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a
      great crashing from the hills.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001011" kind="vs">Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people
      are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001012" kind="vs">And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search
      Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their
      heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001013" kind="vs">Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a
      desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant
      vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001014" kind="vs">The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth
      greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001015" kind="vs">That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a
      day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick
      darkness,</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001016" kind="vs">A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and
      against the high towers.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001017" kind="vs">And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like
      blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as
      dust, and their flesh as the dung.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36001018" kind="vs">Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver
      them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his
      jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</fragment>

        <fragment id="36002008" kind="vs">I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the
      children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against
      their border.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36002009" kind="vs">Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
      Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the
      breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall
      spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36002010" kind="vs">This shall they have for their pride, because they have

        <fragment id="36002014" kind="vs">And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts
      of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it;
      their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he shall
      uncover the cedar work.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36002015" kind="vs">This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
      her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for
      beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</fragment>

        <fragment id="36003002" kind="vs">She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she
      trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.</fragment>

      evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003004" kind="vs">Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests
      have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</fragment>

      shame.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003006" kind="vs">I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made
      their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no
      man, that there is none inhabitant.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003007" kind="vs">I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive
      instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose
      early, and corrupted all their doings.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003008" kind="vs">Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I
      rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the
      kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth
      shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003009" kind="vs">For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they

        <fragment id="36003011" kind="vs">In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
      wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee
      them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003012" kind="vs">I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor

      he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with
      singing.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003018" kind="vs">I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
      who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</fragment>
        <fragment id="36003019" kind="vs">Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I
      will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and
      fame in every land where they have been put to shame.</fragment>
