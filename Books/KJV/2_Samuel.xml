    <chapter id="10001">
      <block id="10001001" type="v">Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</block>
      <block id="10001002" type="v">It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</block>
      <block id="10001003" type="v">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</block>
      <block id="10001004" type="v">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</block>
      <block id="10001005" type="v">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</block>
      <block id="10001006" type="v">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</block>
      <block id="10001007" type="v">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</block>
      <block id="10001008" type="v">And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</block>
      <block id="10001009" type="v">He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</block>
      <block id="10001010" type="v">So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</block>
      <block id="10001011" type="v">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</block>
      <block id="10001012" type="v">And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</block>
      <block id="10001013" type="v">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</block>
      <block id="10001014" type="v">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</block>
      <block id="10001015" type="v">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</block>
      <block id="10001016" type="v">And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</block>
      <block id="10001017" type="v">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</block>
      <block id="10001018" type="v">(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</block>
      <block id="10001019" type="v">The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</block>
      <block id="10001020" type="v">Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</block>
      <block id="10001021" type="v">Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</block>
      <block id="10001022" type="v">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</block>
      <block id="10001023" type="v">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</block>
      <block id="10001024" type="v">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</block>
      <block id="10001025" type="v">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</block>
      <block id="10001026" type="v">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</block>
      <block id="10001027" type="v">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10002">
      <block id="10002001" type="v">And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</block>
      <block id="10002002" type="v">So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</block>
      <block id="10002003" type="v">And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</block>
      <block id="10002004" type="v">And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</block>
      <block id="10002005" type="v">And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</block>
      <block id="10002006" type="v">And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</block>
      <block id="10002007" type="v">Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</block>
      <block id="10002008" type="v">But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</block>
      <block id="10002009" type="v">And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</block>
      <block id="10002010" type="v">Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</block>
      <block id="10002011" type="v">And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</block>
      <block id="10002012" type="v">And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</block>
      <block id="10002013" type="v">And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</block>
      <block id="10002014" type="v">And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</block>
      <block id="10002015" type="v">Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</block>
      <block id="10002016" type="v">And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</block>
      <block id="10002017" type="v">And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</block>
      <block id="10002018" type="v">And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</block>
      <block id="10002019" type="v">And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</block>
      <block id="10002020" type="v">Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</block>
      <block id="10002021" type="v">And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</block>
      <block id="10002022" type="v">And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</block>
      <block id="10002023" type="v">Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</block>
      <block id="10002024" type="v">Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</block>
      <block id="10002025" type="v">And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</block>
      <block id="10002026" type="v">Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</block>
      <block id="10002027" type="v">And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</block>
      <block id="10002028" type="v">So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</block>
      <block id="10002029" type="v">And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</block>
      <block id="10002030" type="v">And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</block>
      <block id="10002031" type="v">But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</block>
      <block id="10002032" type="v">And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10003">
      <block id="10003001" type="v">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</block>
      <block id="10003002" type="v">And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</block>
      <block id="10003003" type="v">And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</block>
      <block id="10003004" type="v">And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</block>
      <block id="10003005" type="v">And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</block>
      <block id="10003006" type="v">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</block>
      <block id="10003007" type="v">And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</block>
      <block id="10003008" type="v">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</block>
      <block id="10003009" type="v">So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</block>
      <block id="10003010" type="v">To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</block>
      <block id="10003011" type="v">And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</block>
      <block id="10003012" type="v">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</block>
      <block id="10003013" type="v">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</block>
      <block id="10003014" type="v">And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</block>
      <block id="10003015" type="v">And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</block>
      <block id="10003016" type="v">And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</block>
      <block id="10003017" type="v">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</block>
      <block id="10003018" type="v">Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</block>
      <block id="10003019" type="v">And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</block>
      <block id="10003020" type="v">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</block>
      <block id="10003021" type="v">And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</block>
      <block id="10003022" type="v">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</block>
      <block id="10003023" type="v">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</block>
      <block id="10003024" type="v">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</block>
      <block id="10003025" type="v">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</block>
      <block id="10003026" type="v">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</block>
      <block id="10003027" type="v">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</block>
      <block id="10003028" type="v">And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</block>
      <block id="10003029" type="v">Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</block>
      <block id="10003030" type="v">So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</block>
      <block id="10003031" type="v">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</block>
      <block id="10003032" type="v">And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</block>
      <block id="10003033" type="v">And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</block>
      <block id="10003034" type="v">Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</block>
      <block id="10003035" type="v">And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</block>
      <block id="10003036" type="v">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</block>
      <block id="10003037" type="v">For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</block>
      <block id="10003038" type="v">And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</block>
      <block id="10003039" type="v">And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10004">
      <block id="10004001" type="v">And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</block>
      <block id="10004002" type="v">And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:</block>
      <block id="10004003" type="v">And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</block>
      <block id="10004004" type="v">And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</block>
      <block id="10004005" type="v">And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</block>
      <block id="10004006" type="v">And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</block>
      <block id="10004007" type="v">For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</block>
      <block id="10004008" type="v">And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</block>
      <block id="10004009" type="v">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</block>
      <block id="10004010" type="v">When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</block>
      <block id="10004011" type="v">How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</block>
      <block id="10004012" type="v">And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10005">
      <block id="10005001" type="v">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</block>
      <block id="10005002" type="v">Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</block>
      <block id="10005003" type="v">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</block>
      <block id="10005004" type="v">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</block>
      <block id="10005005" type="v">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</block>
      <block id="10005006" type="v">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</block>
      <block id="10005007" type="v">Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</block>
      <block id="10005008" type="v">And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</block>
      <block id="10005009" type="v">So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</block>
      <block id="10005010" type="v">And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</block>
      <block id="10005011" type="v">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</block>
      <block id="10005012" type="v">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</block>
      <block id="10005013" type="v">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</block>
      <block id="10005014" type="v">And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</block>
      <block id="10005015" type="v">Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</block>
      <block id="10005016" type="v">And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</block>
      <block id="10005017" type="v">But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</block>

      <block id="10005019" type="v">And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</block>
      <block id="10005020" type="v">And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</block>
      <block id="10005021" type="v">And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</block>

      <block id="10005023" type="v">And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</block>
      <block id="10005024" type="v">And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</block>

    <chapter id="10006">
      <block id="10006001" type="v">Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</block>
      <block id="10006002" type="v">And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.</block>
      <block id="10006003" type="v">And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</block>
      <block id="10006004" type="v">And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</block>
      <block id="10006005" type="v">And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</block>
      <block id="10006006" type="v">And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</block>
      <block id="10006007" type="v">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</block>
      <block id="10006008" type="v">And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.</block>
      <block id="10006009" type="v">And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</block>
      <block id="10006010" type="v">So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</block>
      <block id="10006011" type="v">And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.</block>
      <block id="10006012" type="v">And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</block>
      <block id="10006013" type="v">And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</block>
      <block id="10006014" type="v">And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</block>
      <block id="10006015" type="v">So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</block>
      <block id="10006016" type="v">And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</block>
      <block id="10006017" type="v">And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</block>
      <block id="10006018" type="v">And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.</block>
      <block id="10006019" type="v">And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.</block>
      <block id="10006020" type="v">Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!</block>
      <block id="10006021" type="v">And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.</block>
      <block id="10006022" type="v">And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</block>

      <block id="10007002" type="v">That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</block>
      <block id="10007003" type="v">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.</block>
      <block id="10007004" type="v">And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</block>
      <block id="10007005" type="v">Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</block>
      <block id="10007006" type="v">Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</block>
      <block id="10007007" type="v">In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</block>
      <block id="10007008" type="v">Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</block>
      <block id="10007009" type="v">And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.</block>
      <block id="10007010" type="v">Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</block>
      <block id="10007011" type="v">And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</block>
      <block id="10007012" type="v">And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</block>
      <block id="10007013" type="v">He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</block>
      <block id="10007014" type="v">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</block>
      <block id="10007015" type="v">But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</block>
      <block id="10007016" type="v">And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</block>
      <block id="10007017" type="v">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</block>
      <block id="10007018" type="v">Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</block>
      <block id="10007019" type="v">And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</block>
      <block id="10007020" type="v">And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</block>
      <block id="10007021" type="v">For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</block>
      <block id="10007022" type="v">Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</block>
      <block id="10007023" type="v">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</block>
      <block id="10007024" type="v">For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</block>
      <block id="10007025" type="v">And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</block>
      <block id="10007026" type="v">And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</block>
      <block id="10007027" type="v">For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</block>
      <block id="10007028" type="v">And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</block>
      <block id="10007029" type="v">Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</block>

      <block id="10011019" type="v">And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,</block>
      <block id="10011020" type="v">And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</block>
      <block id="10011021" type="v">Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</block>
      <block id="10011022" type="v">So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.</block>
      <block id="10011023" type="v">And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.</block>
      <block id="10011024" type="v">And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</block>
      <block id="10011025" type="v">Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</block>
      <block id="10011026" type="v">And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</block>
      <block id="10011027" type="v">And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10012">
      <block id="10012001" type="v">And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</block>
      <block id="10012002" type="v">The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</block>
      <block id="10012003" type="v">But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</block>
      <block id="10012004" type="v">And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</block>
      <block id="10012005" type="v">And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:</block>
      <block id="10012006" type="v">And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</block>
      <block id="10012007" type="v">And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</block>
      <block id="10012008" type="v">And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</block>
      <block id="10012009" type="v">Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</block>
      <block id="10012010" type="v">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</block>
      <block id="10012011" type="v">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</block>
      <block id="10012012" type="v">For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</block>
      <block id="10012013" type="v">And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</block>
      <block id="10012014" type="v">Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.</block>
      <block id="10012015" type="v">And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</block>
      <block id="10012016" type="v">David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</block>
      <block id="10012017" type="v">And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</block>
      <block id="10012018" type="v">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</block>
      <block id="10012019" type="v">But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</block>
      <block id="10012020" type="v">Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</block>
      <block id="10012021" type="v">Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</block>
      <block id="10012022" type="v">And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</block>
      <block id="10012023" type="v">But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</block>
      <block id="10012024" type="v">And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</block>
      <block id="10012025" type="v">And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</block>
      <block id="10012026" type="v">And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</block>
      <block id="10012027" type="v">And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</block>
      <block id="10012028" type="v">Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</block>
      <block id="10012029" type="v">And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</block>
      <block id="10012030" type="v">And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</block>
      <block id="10012031" type="v">And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10013">
      <block id="10013001" type="v">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</block>
      <block id="10013002" type="v">And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.</block>
      <block id="10013003" type="v">But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</block>
      <block id="10013004" type="v">And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</block>
      <block id="10013005" type="v">And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</block>
      <block id="10013006" type="v">So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</block>
      <block id="10013007" type="v">Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.</block>
      <block id="10013008" type="v">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</block>
      <block id="10013009" type="v">And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</block>
      <block id="10013010" type="v">And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</block>
      <block id="10013011" type="v">And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</block>
      <block id="10013012" type="v">And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</block>
      <block id="10013013" type="v">And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</block>
      <block id="10013014" type="v">Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</block>
      <block id="10013015" type="v">Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</block>
      <block id="10013016" type="v">And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</block>
      <block id="10013017" type="v">Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</block>
      <block id="10013018" type="v">And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</block>
      <block id="10013019" type="v">And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</block>
      <block id="10013020" type="v">And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</block>
      <block id="10013021" type="v">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</block>
      <block id="10013022" type="v">And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</block>
      <block id="10013023" type="v">And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</block>
      <block id="10013024" type="v">And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</block>
      <block id="10013025" type="v">And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</block>
      <block id="10013026" type="v">Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</block>
      <block id="10013027" type="v">But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</block>
      <block id="10013028" type="v">Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</block>
      <block id="10013029" type="v">And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</block>
      <block id="10013030" type="v">And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</block>
      <block id="10013031" type="v">Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</block>
      <block id="10013032" type="v">And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</block>
      <block id="10013033" type="v">Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</block>
      <block id="10013034" type="v">But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</block>
      <block id="10013035" type="v">And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.</block>
      <block id="10013036" type="v">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</block>
      <block id="10013037" type="v">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</block>
      <block id="10013038" type="v">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</block>
      <block id="10013039" type="v">And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10014">
      <block id="10014001" type="v">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10014002" type="v">And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</block>
      <block id="10014003" type="v">And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</block>
      <block id="10014004" type="v">And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</block>
      <block id="10014005" type="v">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</block>
      <block id="10014006" type="v">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</block>
      <block id="10014007" type="v">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</block>
      <block id="10014008" type="v">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</block>
      <block id="10014009" type="v">And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</block>
      <block id="10014010" type="v">And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</block>
      <block id="10014011" type="v">Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</block>
      <block id="10014012" type="v">Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</block>
      <block id="10014013" type="v">And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</block>
      <block id="10014014" type="v">For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</block>
      <block id="10014015" type="v">Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</block>
      <block id="10014016" type="v">For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</block>
      <block id="10014017" type="v">Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</block>
      <block id="10014018" type="v">Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</block>
      <block id="10014019" type="v">And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</block>
      <block id="10014020" type="v">To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</block>
      <block id="10014021" type="v">And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</block>
      <block id="10014022" type="v">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</block>
      <block id="10014023" type="v">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</block>
      <block id="10014024" type="v">And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</block>
      <block id="10014025" type="v">But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</block>
      <block id="10014026" type="v">And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</block>
      <block id="10014027" type="v">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</block>
      <block id="10014028" type="v">So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</block>
      <block id="10014029" type="v">Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</block>
      <block id="10014030" type="v">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</block>
      <block id="10014031" type="v">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</block>
      <block id="10014032" type="v">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</block>
      <block id="10014033" type="v">So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10015">
      <block id="10015001" type="v">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</block>
      <block id="10015002" type="v">And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</block>
      <block id="10015003" type="v">And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</block>
      <block id="10015004" type="v">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</block>
      <block id="10015005" type="v">And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</block>
      <block id="10015006" type="v">And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</block>
      <block id="10015007" type="v">And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</block>
      <block id="10015008" type="v">For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</block>
      <block id="10015009" type="v">And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</block>
      <block id="10015010" type="v">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</block>
      <block id="10015011" type="v">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</block>
      <block id="10015012" type="v">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10015013" type="v">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10015014" type="v">And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</block>
      <block id="10015015" type="v">And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</block>
      <block id="10015016" type="v">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</block>
      <block id="10015017" type="v">And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</block>
      <block id="10015018" type="v">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</block>
      <block id="10015019" type="v">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</block>
      <block id="10015020" type="v">Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</block>
      <block id="10015021" type="v">And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</block>
      <block id="10015022" type="v">And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</block>
      <block id="10015023" type="v">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</block>
      <block id="10015024" type="v">And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</block>
      <block id="10015025" type="v">And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:</block>
      <block id="10015026" type="v">But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</block>
      <block id="10015027" type="v">The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</block>
      <block id="10015028" type="v">See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</block>
      <block id="10015029" type="v">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</block>
      <block id="10015030" type="v">And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</block>
      <block id="10015031" type="v">And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</block>
      <block id="10015032" type="v">And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</block>
      <block id="10015033" type="v">Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</block>
      <block id="10015034" type="v">But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</block>
      <block id="10015035" type="v">And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</block>
      <block id="10015036" type="v">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</block>
      <block id="10015037" type="v">So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10016">
      <block id="10016001" type="v">And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</block>
      <block id="10016002" type="v">And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</block>
      <block id="10016003" type="v">And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</block>
      <block id="10016004" type="v">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</block>
      <block id="10016005" type="v">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</block>
      <block id="10016006" type="v">And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</block>
      <block id="10016007" type="v">And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</block>
      <block id="10016008" type="v">The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</block>
      <block id="10016009" type="v">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</block>
      <block id="10016010" type="v">And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</block>
      <block id="10016011" type="v">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</block>
      <block id="10016012" type="v">It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</block>
      <block id="10016013" type="v">And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</block>
      <block id="10016014" type="v">And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</block>
      <block id="10016015" type="v">And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</block>
      <block id="10016016" type="v">And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</block>
      <block id="10016017" type="v">And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</block>
      <block id="10016018" type="v">And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</block>
      <block id="10016019" type="v">And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</block>
      <block id="10016020" type="v">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</block>
      <block id="10016021" type="v">And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</block>
      <block id="10016022" type="v">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</block>
      <block id="10016023" type="v">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10017">
      <block id="10017001" type="v">Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</block>
      <block id="10017002" type="v">And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:</block>
      <block id="10017003" type="v">And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</block>
      <block id="10017004" type="v">And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</block>
      <block id="10017005" type="v">Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</block>
      <block id="10017006" type="v">And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.</block>
      <block id="10017007" type="v">And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.</block>
      <block id="10017008" type="v">For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</block>
      <block id="10017009" type="v">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10017010" type="v">And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.</block>
      <block id="10017011" type="v">Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</block>
      <block id="10017012" type="v">So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</block>
      <block id="10017013" type="v">Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</block>
      <block id="10017014" type="v">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10017015" type="v">Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</block>
      <block id="10017016" type="v">Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</block>
      <block id="10017017" type="v">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.</block>
      <block id="10017018" type="v">Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.</block>
      <block id="10017019" type="v">And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</block>
      <block id="10017020" type="v">And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</block>
      <block id="10017021" type="v">And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</block>
      <block id="10017022" type="v">Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</block>
      <block id="10017023" type="v">And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</block>
      <block id="10017024" type="v">Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</block>
      <block id="10017025" type="v">And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</block>
      <block id="10017026" type="v">So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</block>
      <block id="10017027" type="v">And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</block>
      <block id="10017028" type="v">Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,</block>
      <block id="10017029" type="v">And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10018">
      <block id="10018001" type="v">And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</block>
      <block id="10018002" type="v">And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</block>
      <block id="10018003" type="v">But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</block>
      <block id="10018004" type="v">And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</block>
      <block id="10018005" type="v">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10018006" type="v">So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</block>
      <block id="10018007" type="v">Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</block>
      <block id="10018008" type="v">For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</block>
      <block id="10018009" type="v">And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</block>
      <block id="10018010" type="v">And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</block>
      <block id="10018011" type="v">And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</block>
      <block id="10018012" type="v">And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10018013" type="v">Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</block>
      <block id="10018014" type="v">Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</block>
      <block id="10018015" type="v">And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</block>
      <block id="10018016" type="v">And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</block>
      <block id="10018017" type="v">And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</block>
      <block id="10018018" type="v">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</block>
      <block id="10018019" type="v">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</block>
      <block id="10018020" type="v">And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</block>
      <block id="10018021" type="v">Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</block>
      <block id="10018022" type="v">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</block>
      <block id="10018023" type="v">But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</block>
      <block id="10018024" type="v">And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</block>
      <block id="10018025" type="v">And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</block>
      <block id="10018026" type="v">And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</block>
      <block id="10018027" type="v">And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</block>
      <block id="10018028" type="v">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</block>
      <block id="10018029" type="v">And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</block>
      <block id="10018030" type="v">And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</block>
      <block id="10018031" type="v">And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</block>
      <block id="10018032" type="v">And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</block>
      <block id="10018033" type="v">And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10019">
      <block id="10019001" type="v">And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10019002" type="v">And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</block>
      <block id="10019003" type="v">And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</block>
      <block id="10019004" type="v">But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</block>
      <block id="10019005" type="v">And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</block>
      <block id="10019006" type="v">In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</block>
      <block id="10019007" type="v">Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</block>
      <block id="10019008" type="v">Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</block>
      <block id="10019009" type="v">And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</block>
      <block id="10019010" type="v">And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</block>
      <block id="10019011" type="v">And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.</block>
      <block id="10019012" type="v">Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?</block>
      <block id="10019013" type="v">And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.</block>
      <block id="10019014" type="v">And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</block>
      <block id="10019015" type="v">So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</block>
      <block id="10019016" type="v">And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</block>
      <block id="10019017" type="v">And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</block>
      <block id="10019018" type="v">And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</block>
      <block id="10019019" type="v">And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</block>
      <block id="10019020" type="v">For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</block>
      <block id="10019021" type="v">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?</block>
      <block id="10019022" type="v">And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</block>
      <block id="10019023" type="v">Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</block>
      <block id="10019024" type="v">And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</block>
      <block id="10019025" type="v">And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</block>
      <block id="10019026" type="v">And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</block>
      <block id="10019027" type="v">And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.</block>
      <block id="10019028" type="v">For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</block>
      <block id="10019029" type="v">And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</block>
      <block id="10019030" type="v">And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</block>
      <block id="10019031" type="v">And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</block>
      <block id="10019032" type="v">Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</block>
      <block id="10019033" type="v">And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</block>
      <block id="10019034" type="v">And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</block>
      <block id="10019035" type="v">I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</block>
      <block id="10019036" type="v">Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</block>
      <block id="10019037" type="v">Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.</block>
      <block id="10019038" type="v">And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</block>
      <block id="10019039" type="v">And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</block>
      <block id="10019040" type="v">Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</block>
      <block id="10019041" type="v">And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?</block>
      <block id="10019042" type="v">And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?</block>
      <block id="10019043" type="v">And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</block>

    <chapter id="10020">
      <block id="10020001" type="v">And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</block>
      <block id="10020002" type="v">So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</block>
      <block id="10020003" type="v">And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</block>
      <block id="10020004" type="v">Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.</block>
      <block id="10020005" type="v">So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</block>
      <block id="10020006" type="v">And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</block>
      <block id="10020007" type="v">And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</block>
      <block id="10020008" type="v">When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.</block>
      <block id="10020009" type="v">And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</block>
      <block id="10020010" type="v">But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</block>
      <block id="10020011" type="v">And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.</block>
      <block id="10020012" type="v">And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</block>
      <block id="10020013" type="v">When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</block>
      <block id="10020014" type="v">And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</block>
      <block id="10020015" type="v">And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</block>
      <block id="10020016" type="v">Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</block>
      <block id="10020017" type="v">And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</block>
      <block id="10020018" type="v">Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.</block>
      <block id="10020019" type="v">I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</block>
      <block id="10020020" type="v">And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</block>
      <block id="10020021" type="v">The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.</block>
      <block id="10020022" type="v">Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</block>
      <block id="10020023" type="v">Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</block>
      <block id="10020024" type="v">And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:</block>

      <block id="10020026" type="v">And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</block>

    <chapter id="10021">
      <block id="10021001" type="v">Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</block>
      <block id="10021002" type="v">And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</block>
      <block id="10021003" type="v">Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?</block>
      <block id="10021004" type="v">And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.</block>
      <block id="10021005" type="v">And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,</block>
      <block id="10021006" type="v">Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</block>
      <block id="10021007" type="v">But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</block>
      <block id="10021008" type="v">But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</block>
      <block id="10021009" type="v">And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</block>
      <block id="10021010" type="v">And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</block>
      <block id="10021011" type="v">And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</block>
      <block id="10021012" type="v">And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:</block>
      <block id="10021013" type="v">And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</block>
      <block id="10021014" type="v">And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.</block>
      <block id="10021015" type="v">Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.</block>
      <block id="10021016" type="v">And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</block>
      <block id="10021017" type="v">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.</block>
      <block id="10021018" type="v">And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.</block>
      <block id="10021019" type="v">And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</block>
      <block id="10021020" type="v">And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</block>
      <block id="10021021" type="v">And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him.</block>
      <block id="10021022" type="v">These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="10022">
      <block id="10022001" type="v">And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</block>

      <block id="10022003" type="v">The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</block>
      <block id="10022004" type="v">I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</block>

      <block id="10022007" type="v">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</block>
      <block id="10022008" type="v">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</block>
      <block id="10022009" type="v">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</block>
      <block id="10022010" type="v">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</block>
      <block id="10022011" type="v">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</block>
      <block id="10022012" type="v">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</block>
      <block id="10022013" type="v">Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</block>
      <block id="10022014" type="v">The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</block>
      <block id="10022015" type="v">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</block>
      <block id="10022016" type="v">And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</block>
      <block id="10022017" type="v">He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</block>
      <block id="10022018" type="v">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</block>

      <block id="10022035" type="v">He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</block>
      <block id="10022036" type="v">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</block>
      <block id="10022037" type="v">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</block>
      <block id="10022038" type="v">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</block>
      <block id="10022039" type="v">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</block>

      <block id="10022041" type="v">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</block>
      <block id="10022042" type="v">They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</block>
      <block id="10022043" type="v">Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</block>
      <block id="10022044" type="v">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</block>
      <block id="10022045" type="v">Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</block>

    <chapter id="10023">
      <block id="10023001" type="v">Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</block>
      <block id="10023002" type="v">The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</block>
      <block id="10023003" type="v">The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</block>
      <block id="10023004" type="v">And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</block>
      <block id="10023005" type="v">Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</block>
      <block id="10023006" type="v">But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</block>
      <block id="10023007" type="v">But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</block>
      <block id="10023008" type="v">These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</block>
      <block id="10023009" type="v">And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</block>
      <block id="10023010" type="v">He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</block>
      <block id="10023011" type="v">And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</block>
      <block id="10023012" type="v">But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</block>
      <block id="10023013" type="v">And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</block>
      <block id="10023014" type="v">And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</block>
      <block id="10023015" type="v">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</block>
      <block id="10023016" type="v">And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</block>
      <block id="10023017" type="v">And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</block>
      <block id="10023018" type="v">And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.</block>
      <block id="10023019" type="v">Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.</block>
      <block id="10023020" type="v">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</block>
      <block id="10023021" type="v">And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</block>
      <block id="10023022" type="v">These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</block>
      <block id="10023023" type="v">He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.</block>
      <block id="10023024" type="v">Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</block>

    <chapter id="10024">
      <block id="10024001" type="v">And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</block>
      <block id="10024002" type="v">For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</block>
      <block id="10024003" type="v">And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</block>
      <block id="10024004" type="v">Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</block>
      <block id="10024005" type="v">And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</block>
      <block id="10024006" type="v">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</block>
      <block id="10024007" type="v">And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</block>
      <block id="10024008" type="v">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</block>
      <block id="10024009" type="v">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</block>
      <block id="10024010" type="v">And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</block>
      <block id="10024011" type="v">For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</block>
      <block id="10024012" type="v">Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</block>
      <block id="10024013" type="v">So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</block>
      <block id="10024014" type="v">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</block>
      <block id="10024015" type="v">So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</block>
      <block id="10024016" type="v">And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</block>
      <block id="10024017" type="v">And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</block>
      <block id="10024018" type="v">And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</block>
      <block id="10024019" type="v">And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</block>
      <block id="10024020" type="v">And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</block>
      <block id="10024021" type="v">And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</block>
      <block id="10024022" type="v">And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</block>
      <block id="10024023" type="v">All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</block>
      <block id="10024024" type="v">And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</block>
      <block id="10024025" type="v">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</block>
