    <chapter n="1">
      <verse n="1" id="3john.1.1">The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
      <verse n="2" id="3john.1.2">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</verse>
      <verse n="3" id="3john.1.3">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</verse>
      <verse n="4" id="3john.1.4">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</verse>
      <verse n="5" id="3john.1.5">Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</verse>
      <verse n="6" id="3john.1.6">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</verse>
      <verse n="7" id="3john.1.7">Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
      <verse n="8" id="3john.1.8">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</verse>
      <verse n="9" id="3john.1.9">I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</verse>
      <verse n="10" id="3john.1.10">Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</verse>
      <verse n="11" id="3john.1.11">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</verse>
      <verse n="12" id="3john.1.12">Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</verse>
      <verse n="13" id="3john.1.13">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</verse>
      <verse n="14" id="3john.1.14">But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
