        <ab id="64001001" type="verse">The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</ab>
        <ab id="64001002" type="verse">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</ab>
        <ab id="64001003" type="verse">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</ab>
        <ab id="64001004" type="verse">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</ab>
        <ab id="64001005" type="verse">Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</ab>
        <ab id="64001006" type="verse">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</ab>
        <ab id="64001007" type="verse">Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</ab>
        <ab id="64001008" type="verse">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</ab>
        <ab id="64001009" type="verse">I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</ab>
        <ab id="64001010" type="verse">Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</ab>
        <ab id="64001011" type="verse">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</ab>
        <ab id="64001012" type="verse">Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</ab>
        <ab id="64001013" type="verse">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</ab>
        <ab id="64001014" type="verse">But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</ab>
