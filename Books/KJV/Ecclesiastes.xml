    <frag id="21001001" type="vs">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="21001002" type="vs">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21001003" type="vs">What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</frag>
    <frag id="21001004" type="vs">One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</frag>
    <frag id="21001005" type="vs">The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</frag>
    <frag id="21001006" type="vs">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</frag>
    <frag id="21001007" type="vs">All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</frag>
    <frag id="21001008" type="vs">All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</frag>
    <frag id="21001009" type="vs">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</frag>
    <frag id="21001010" type="vs">Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</frag>
    <frag id="21001011" type="vs">There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</frag>
    <frag id="21001012" type="vs">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</frag>
    <frag id="21001013" type="vs">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</frag>
    <frag id="21001014" type="vs">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</frag>
    <frag id="21001015" type="vs">That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</frag>
    <frag id="21001016" type="vs">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</frag>
    <frag id="21001017" type="vs">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</frag>
    <frag id="21001018" type="vs">For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</frag>
  </sec>
  <sec type="ch" id="21002">
    <frag id="21002001" type="vs">I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21002002" type="vs">I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</frag>
    <frag id="21002003" type="vs">I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</frag>
    <frag id="21002004" type="vs">I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</frag>
    <frag id="21002005" type="vs">I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:</frag>
    <frag id="21002006" type="vs">I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</frag>
    <frag id="21002007" type="vs">I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</frag>
    <frag id="21002008" type="vs">I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</frag>
    <frag id="21002009" type="vs">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</frag>
    <frag id="21002010" type="vs">And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</frag>
    <frag id="21002011" type="vs">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</frag>
    <frag id="21002012" type="vs">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.</frag>
    <frag id="21002013" type="vs">Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</frag>
    <frag id="21002014" type="vs">The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</frag>
    <frag id="21002015" type="vs">Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21002016" type="vs">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</frag>
    <frag id="21002017" type="vs">Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</frag>
    <frag id="21002018" type="vs">Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</frag>
    <frag id="21002019" type="vs">And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21002020" type="vs">Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</frag>
    <frag id="21002021" type="vs">For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</frag>
    <frag id="21002022" type="vs">For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</frag>
    <frag id="21002023" type="vs">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21002024" type="vs">There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</frag>
    <frag id="21002025" type="vs">For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</frag>
    <frag id="21002026" type="vs">For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</frag>

    <frag id="21003001" type="vs">To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</frag>
    <frag id="21003002" type="vs">A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</frag>
    <frag id="21003003" type="vs">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</frag>
    <frag id="21003004" type="vs">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</frag>
    <frag id="21003005" type="vs">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</frag>
    <frag id="21003006" type="vs">A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</frag>
    <frag id="21003007" type="vs">A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</frag>
    <frag id="21003008" type="vs">A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</frag>
    <frag id="21003009" type="vs">What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</frag>
    <frag id="21003010" type="vs">I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</frag>
    <frag id="21003011" type="vs">He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</frag>
    <frag id="21003012" type="vs">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</frag>
    <frag id="21003013" type="vs">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</frag>
    <frag id="21003014" type="vs">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</frag>
    <frag id="21003015" type="vs">That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</frag>
    <frag id="21003016" type="vs">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</frag>
    <frag id="21003017" type="vs">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</frag>
    <frag id="21003018" type="vs">I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</frag>
    <frag id="21003019" type="vs">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21003020" type="vs">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</frag>
    <frag id="21003021" type="vs">Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</frag>
    <frag id="21003022" type="vs">Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</frag>

  <sec type="ch" id="21004">
    <frag id="21004001" type="vs">So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</frag>
    <frag id="21004002" type="vs">Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</frag>
    <frag id="21004003" type="vs">Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</frag>
    <frag id="21004004" type="vs">Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</frag>
    <frag id="21004005" type="vs">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</frag>
    <frag id="21004006" type="vs">Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</frag>
    <frag id="21004007" type="vs">Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</frag>
    <frag id="21004008" type="vs">There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</frag>
    <frag id="21004009" type="vs">Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</frag>
    <frag id="21004010" type="vs">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</frag>
    <frag id="21004011" type="vs">Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</frag>
    <frag id="21004012" type="vs">And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</frag>
    <frag id="21004013" type="vs">Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</frag>
    <frag id="21004014" type="vs">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</frag>
    <frag id="21004015" type="vs">I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</frag>
    <frag id="21004016" type="vs">There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</frag>

    <frag id="21005018" type="vs">Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.</frag>
    <frag id="21005019" type="vs">Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.</frag>

    <frag id="21008008" type="vs">There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</frag>
    <frag id="21008009" type="vs">All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</frag>
    <frag id="21008010" type="vs">And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21008011" type="vs">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</frag>

    <frag id="21008014" type="vs">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</frag>
    <frag id="21008015" type="vs">Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</frag>
    <frag id="21008016" type="vs">When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</frag>
    <frag id="21008017" type="vs">Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</frag>

    <frag id="21009001" type="vs">For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.</frag>
    <frag id="21009002" type="vs">All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</frag>

    <frag id="21009009" type="vs">Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</frag>
    <frag id="21009010" type="vs">Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</frag>

    <frag id="21009012" type="vs">For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</frag>
    <frag id="21009013" type="vs">This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:</frag>
    <frag id="21009014" type="vs">There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</frag>
    <frag id="21009015" type="vs">Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</frag>
    <frag id="21009016" type="vs">Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</frag>
    <frag id="21009017" type="vs">The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</frag>
    <frag id="21009018" type="vs">Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.</frag>
