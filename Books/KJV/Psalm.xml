          <ab id="19078043" type="verse">How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</ab>

          <ab id="19078056" type="verse">Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</ab>
          <ab id="19078057" type="verse">But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</ab>
          <ab id="19078058" type="verse">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</ab>
          <ab id="19078059" type="verse">When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</ab>
          <ab id="19078060" type="verse">So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</ab>
          <ab id="19078061" type="verse">And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</ab>
          <ab id="19078062" type="verse">He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</ab>
          <ab id="19078063" type="verse">The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</ab>
          <ab id="19078064" type="verse">Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</ab>
          <ab id="19078065" type="verse">Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</ab>
          <ab id="19078066" type="verse">And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</ab>
          <ab id="19078067" type="verse">Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</ab>
          <ab id="19078068" type="verse">But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</ab>
          <ab id="19078069" type="verse">And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</ab>
          <ab id="19078070" type="verse">He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</ab>
          <ab id="19078071" type="verse">From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</ab>

          <ab id="19102018" type="verse">This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</ab>
          <ab id="19102019" type="verse">For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</ab>
          <ab id="19102020" type="verse">To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</ab>
          <ab id="19102021" type="verse">To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</ab>
          <ab id="19102022" type="verse">When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</ab>
          <ab id="19102023" type="verse">He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</ab>
          <ab id="19102024" type="verse">I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.</ab>
          <ab id="19102025" type="verse">Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</ab>
          <ab id="19102026" type="verse">They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</ab>
          <ab id="19102027" type="verse">But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</ab>
          <ab id="19102028" type="verse">The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</ab>
