        <fragment id="19078001" kind="vs">Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078002" kind="vs">I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078003" kind="vs">Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078004" kind="vs">We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078005" kind="vs">For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078006" kind="vs">That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078007" kind="vs">That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078008" kind="vs">And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078009" kind="vs">The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078010" kind="vs">They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078011" kind="vs">And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078012" kind="vs">Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078013" kind="vs">He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078014" kind="vs">In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078015" kind="vs">He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078016" kind="vs">He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078017" kind="vs">And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078018" kind="vs">And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078019" kind="vs">Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078020" kind="vs">Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078021" kind="vs">Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078022" kind="vs">Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078023" kind="vs">Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078024" kind="vs">And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078025" kind="vs">Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078026" kind="vs">He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078027" kind="vs">He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078028" kind="vs">And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078029" kind="vs">So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078030" kind="vs">They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078031" kind="vs">The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078032" kind="vs">For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078033" kind="vs">Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078034" kind="vs">When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078035" kind="vs">And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078036" kind="vs">Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078037" kind="vs">For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078038" kind="vs">But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078039" kind="vs">For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078040" kind="vs">How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078041" kind="vs">Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078042" kind="vs">They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078043" kind="vs">How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078044" kind="vs">And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078045" kind="vs">He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078046" kind="vs">He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078047" kind="vs">He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078048" kind="vs">He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078049" kind="vs">He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078050" kind="vs">He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078051" kind="vs">And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078052" kind="vs">But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078053" kind="vs">And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078054" kind="vs">And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078055" kind="vs">He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078056" kind="vs">Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078057" kind="vs">But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078058" kind="vs">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078059" kind="vs">When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078060" kind="vs">So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078061" kind="vs">And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078062" kind="vs">He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078063" kind="vs">The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078064" kind="vs">Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078065" kind="vs">Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078066" kind="vs">And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078067" kind="vs">Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078068" kind="vs">But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078069" kind="vs">And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078070" kind="vs">He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078071" kind="vs">From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</fragment>
        <fragment id="19078072" kind="vs">So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</fragment>
