          <ab id="66001001" type="verse">The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:</ab>
          <ab id="66001002" type="verse">Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</ab>
          <ab id="66001003" type="verse">Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.</ab>
          <ab id="66001004" type="verse">John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</ab>
          <ab id="66001005" type="verse">And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</ab>
          <ab id="66001006" type="verse">And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</ab>
          <ab id="66001007" type="verse">Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</ab>
          <ab id="66001008" type="verse">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</ab>
          <ab id="66001009" type="verse">I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</ab>
          <ab id="66001010" type="verse">I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</ab>
          <ab id="66001011" type="verse">Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</ab>
          <ab id="66001012" type="verse">And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</ab>
          <ab id="66001013" type="verse">And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</ab>
          <ab id="66001014" type="verse">His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</ab>
          <ab id="66001015" type="verse">And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</ab>
          <ab id="66001016" type="verse">And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</ab>
          <ab id="66001017" type="verse">And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</ab>
          <ab id="66001018" type="verse">I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</ab>
          <ab id="66001019" type="verse">Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</ab>
          <ab id="66001020" type="verse">The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="66002">
          <ab id="66002001" type="verse">Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</ab>
          <ab id="66002002" type="verse">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</ab>
          <ab id="66002003" type="verse">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</ab>
          <ab id="66002004" type="verse">Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</ab>
          <ab id="66002005" type="verse">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</ab>
          <ab id="66002006" type="verse">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</ab>
          <ab id="66002007" type="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</ab>
          <ab id="66002008" type="verse">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</ab>
          <ab id="66002009" type="verse">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</ab>
          <ab id="66002010" type="verse">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</ab>
          <ab id="66002011" type="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</ab>
          <ab id="66002012" type="verse">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</ab>
          <ab id="66002013" type="verse">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</ab>
          <ab id="66002014" type="verse">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</ab>
          <ab id="66002015" type="verse">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</ab>
          <ab id="66002016" type="verse">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</ab>
          <ab id="66002017" type="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</ab>
          <ab id="66002018" type="verse">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</ab>
          <ab id="66002019" type="verse">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</ab>
          <ab id="66002020" type="verse">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</ab>
          <ab id="66002021" type="verse">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</ab>
          <ab id="66002022" type="verse">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</ab>
          <ab id="66002023" type="verse">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</ab>
          <ab id="66002024" type="verse">But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</ab>
          <ab id="66002025" type="verse">But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</ab>
          <ab id="66002026" type="verse">And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</ab>
          <ab id="66002027" type="verse">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</ab>
          <ab id="66002028" type="verse">And I will give him the morning star.</ab>
          <ab id="66002029" type="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="66003">
          <ab id="66003001" type="verse">And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</ab>
          <ab id="66003002" type="verse">Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</ab>
          <ab id="66003003" type="verse">Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</ab>
          <ab id="66003004" type="verse">Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</ab>
          <ab id="66003005" type="verse">He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</ab>
          <ab id="66003006" type="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</ab>
          <ab id="66003007" type="verse">And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</ab>
          <ab id="66003008" type="verse">I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</ab>
          <ab id="66003009" type="verse">Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</ab>
          <ab id="66003010" type="verse">Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</ab>
          <ab id="66003011" type="verse">Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</ab>
          <ab id="66003012" type="verse">Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.</ab>
          <ab id="66003013" type="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</ab>
          <ab id="66003014" type="verse">And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</ab>
          <ab id="66003015" type="verse">I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</ab>
          <ab id="66003016" type="verse">So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</ab>
          <ab id="66003017" type="verse">Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</ab>
          <ab id="66003018" type="verse">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</ab>
          <ab id="66003019" type="verse">As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</ab>
          <ab id="66003020" type="verse">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</ab>
          <ab id="66003021" type="verse">To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="66004">
          <ab id="66004001" type="verse">After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</ab>
          <ab id="66004002" type="verse">And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</ab>
          <ab id="66004003" type="verse">And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</ab>
          <ab id="66004004" type="verse">And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</ab>
          <ab id="66004005" type="verse">And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</ab>
          <ab id="66004006" type="verse">And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</ab>
          <ab id="66004007" type="verse">And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</ab>
          <ab id="66004008" type="verse">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</ab>
          <ab id="66004009" type="verse">And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</ab>
          <ab id="66004010" type="verse">The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="66004011" type="verse">Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="66005">
          <ab id="66005001" type="verse">And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</ab>
          <ab id="66005002" type="verse">And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</ab>
          <ab id="66005003" type="verse">And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</ab>
          <ab id="66005004" type="verse">And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</ab>
          <ab id="66005005" type="verse">And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</ab>
          <ab id="66005006" type="verse">And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</ab>
          <ab id="66005007" type="verse">And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</ab>
          <ab id="66005008" type="verse">And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</ab>
          <ab id="66005009" type="verse">And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</ab>
          <ab id="66005010" type="verse">And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</ab>
          <ab id="66005011" type="verse">And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</ab>
          <ab id="66005012" type="verse">Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</ab>
          <ab id="66005013" type="verse">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</ab>
          <ab id="66005014" type="verse">And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="66006">
          <ab id="66006001" type="verse">And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.</ab>
          <ab id="66006002" type="verse">And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</ab>
          <ab id="66006003" type="verse">And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.</ab>
          <ab id="66006004" type="verse">And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</ab>
          <ab id="66006005" type="verse">And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</ab>
          <ab id="66006006" type="verse">And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</ab>
          <ab id="66006007" type="verse">And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</ab>
          <ab id="66006008" type="verse">And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</ab>
          <ab id="66006009" type="verse">And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</ab>
          <ab id="66006010" type="verse">And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</ab>
          <ab id="66006011" type="verse">And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</ab>
          <ab id="66006012" type="verse">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</ab>
          <ab id="66006013" type="verse">And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</ab>
          <ab id="66006014" type="verse">And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</ab>
          <ab id="66006015" type="verse">And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</ab>
          <ab id="66006016" type="verse">And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</ab>

          <ab id="66007001" type="verse">And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</ab>
          <ab id="66007002" type="verse">And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</ab>
          <ab id="66007003" type="verse">Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</ab>

          <ab id="66021001" type="verse">And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</ab>
          <ab id="66021002" type="verse">And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</ab>
          <ab id="66021003" type="verse">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</ab>
          <ab id="66021004" type="verse">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</ab>
          <ab id="66021005" type="verse">And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</ab>
          <ab id="66021006" type="verse">And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.</ab>

          <ab id="66021009" type="verse">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</ab>
          <ab id="66021010" type="verse">And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,</ab>
          <ab id="66021011" type="verse">Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</ab>
          <ab id="66021012" type="verse">And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</ab>
          <ab id="66021013" type="verse">On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</ab>
          <ab id="66021014" type="verse">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</ab>
          <ab id="66021015" type="verse">And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</ab>
          <ab id="66021016" type="verse">And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</ab>
          <ab id="66021017" type="verse">And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</ab>
          <ab id="66021018" type="verse">And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</ab>
          <ab id="66021019" type="verse">And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</ab>
          <ab id="66021020" type="verse">The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</ab>
          <ab id="66021021" type="verse">And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</ab>
          <ab id="66021022" type="verse">And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</ab>
          <ab id="66021023" type="verse">And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</ab>
          <ab id="66021024" type="verse">And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</ab>
          <ab id="66021025" type="verse">And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.</ab>
          <ab id="66021026" type="verse">And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</ab>
          <ab id="66021027" type="verse">And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.</ab>

          <ab id="66022001" type="verse">And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</ab>
          <ab id="66022002" type="verse">In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</ab>
          <ab id="66022003" type="verse">And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</ab>
          <ab id="66022004" type="verse">And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.</ab>
          <ab id="66022005" type="verse">And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</ab>
          <ab id="66022006" type="verse">And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</ab>
          <ab id="66022007" type="verse">Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</ab>
          <ab id="66022008" type="verse">And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.</ab>
          <ab id="66022009" type="verse">Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</ab>
          <ab id="66022010" type="verse">And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</ab>
          <ab id="66022011" type="verse">He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</ab>
          <ab id="66022012" type="verse">And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</ab>
          <ab id="66022013" type="verse">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</ab>
          <ab id="66022014" type="verse">Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</ab>
          <ab id="66022015" type="verse">For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</ab>
          <ab id="66022016" type="verse">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</ab>
          <ab id="66022017" type="verse">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</ab>
          <ab id="66022018" type="verse">For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</ab>
          <ab id="66022019" type="verse">And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</ab>
          <ab id="66022020" type="verse">He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</ab>
          <ab id="66022021" type="verse">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</ab>
