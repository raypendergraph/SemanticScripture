        <fragment id="58001001" kind="vs">God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001002" kind="vs">Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001003" kind="vs">Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001004" kind="vs">Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001005" kind="vs">For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001006" kind="vs">And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001007" kind="vs">And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001008" kind="vs">But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001009" kind="vs">Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001010" kind="vs">And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001011" kind="vs">They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001012" kind="vs">And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001013" kind="vs">But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</fragment>
        <fragment id="58001014" kind="vs">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</fragment>

        <fragment id="58002001" kind="vs">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002002" kind="vs">For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002003" kind="vs">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002004" kind="vs">God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002005" kind="vs">For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002006" kind="vs">But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002007" kind="vs">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002008" kind="vs">Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002009" kind="vs">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002010" kind="vs">For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002011" kind="vs">For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002012" kind="vs">Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002013" kind="vs">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002014" kind="vs">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002015" kind="vs">And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002016" kind="vs">For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002017" kind="vs">Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58002018" kind="vs">For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</fragment>

        <fragment id="58003001" kind="vs">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003002" kind="vs">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003003" kind="vs">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003004" kind="vs">For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003005" kind="vs">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003006" kind="vs">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003007" kind="vs">Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003008" kind="vs">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003009" kind="vs">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003010" kind="vs">Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003011" kind="vs">So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003012" kind="vs">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003013" kind="vs">But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003014" kind="vs">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003015" kind="vs">While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003016" kind="vs">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003017" kind="vs">But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003018" kind="vs">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</fragment>
        <fragment id="58003019" kind="vs">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</fragment>

    <section kind="ch" id="58004">
      <fragments>
        <fragment id="58004001" kind="vs">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004002" kind="vs">For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004003" kind="vs">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004004" kind="vs">For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004005" kind="vs">And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004006" kind="vs">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004007" kind="vs">Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004008" kind="vs">For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004009" kind="vs">There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004010" kind="vs">For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004011" kind="vs">Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004012" kind="vs">For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004013" kind="vs">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004014" kind="vs">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004015" kind="vs">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58004016" kind="vs">Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</fragment>

      <fragments>
        <fragment id="58005001" kind="vs">For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005002" kind="vs">Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005003" kind="vs">And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005004" kind="vs">And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005005" kind="vs">So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005006" kind="vs">As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005007" kind="vs">Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005008" kind="vs">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005009" kind="vs">And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005010" kind="vs">Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005011" kind="vs">Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005012" kind="vs">For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005013" kind="vs">For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58005014" kind="vs">But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</fragment>

        <fragment id="58006001" kind="vs">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006002" kind="vs">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006003" kind="vs">And this will we do, if God permit.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006004" kind="vs">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006005" kind="vs">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006006" kind="vs">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006007" kind="vs">For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006008" kind="vs">But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006009" kind="vs">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006010" kind="vs">For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006011" kind="vs">And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006012" kind="vs">That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006013" kind="vs">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006014" kind="vs">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006015" kind="vs">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006016" kind="vs">For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006017" kind="vs">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006018" kind="vs">That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006019" kind="vs">Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58006020" kind="vs">Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</fragment>

        <fragment id="58007001" kind="vs">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007002" kind="vs">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007003" kind="vs">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007004" kind="vs">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007005" kind="vs">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007006" kind="vs">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007007" kind="vs">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007008" kind="vs">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007009" kind="vs">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007010" kind="vs">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007011" kind="vs">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007012" kind="vs">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007013" kind="vs">For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007014" kind="vs">For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007015" kind="vs">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007016" kind="vs">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007017" kind="vs">For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007018" kind="vs">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007019" kind="vs">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007020" kind="vs">And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007021" kind="vs">For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007022" kind="vs">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007023" kind="vs">And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007024" kind="vs">But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007025" kind="vs">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007026" kind="vs">For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007027" kind="vs">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58007028" kind="vs">For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</fragment>

        <fragment id="58008003" kind="vs">For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</fragment>
        <fragment id="58008004" kind="vs">For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</fragment>

        <fragment id="58008006" kind="vs">But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</fragment>
