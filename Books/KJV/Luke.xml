          <ab id="42001001" type="verse">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</ab>
          <ab id="42001002" type="verse">Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</ab>
          <ab id="42001003" type="verse">It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</ab>
          <ab id="42001004" type="verse">That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</ab>
          <ab id="42001005" type="verse">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</ab>
          <ab id="42001006" type="verse">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</ab>
          <ab id="42001007" type="verse">And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</ab>
          <ab id="42001008" type="verse">And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</ab>
          <ab id="42001009" type="verse">According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</ab>
          <ab id="42001010" type="verse">And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</ab>
          <ab id="42001011" type="verse">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</ab>
          <ab id="42001012" type="verse">And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</ab>
          <ab id="42001013" type="verse">But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</ab>
          <ab id="42001014" type="verse">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</ab>
          <ab id="42001015" type="verse">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</ab>
          <ab id="42001016" type="verse">And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</ab>
          <ab id="42001017" type="verse">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</ab>
          <ab id="42001018" type="verse">And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</ab>
          <ab id="42001019" type="verse">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</ab>
          <ab id="42001020" type="verse">And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</ab>
          <ab id="42001021" type="verse">And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</ab>
          <ab id="42001022" type="verse">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</ab>
          <ab id="42001023" type="verse">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</ab>
          <ab id="42001024" type="verse">And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="42001025" type="verse">Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</ab>
          <ab id="42001026" type="verse">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</ab>
          <ab id="42001027" type="verse">To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</ab>
          <ab id="42001028" type="verse">And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</ab>
          <ab id="42001029" type="verse">And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</ab>
          <ab id="42001030" type="verse">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</ab>
          <ab id="42001031" type="verse">And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</ab>
          <ab id="42001032" type="verse">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</ab>
          <ab id="42001033" type="verse">And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</ab>
          <ab id="42001034" type="verse">Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</ab>
          <ab id="42001035" type="verse">And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</ab>
          <ab id="42001036" type="verse">And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</ab>
          <ab id="42001037" type="verse">For with God nothing shall be impossible.</ab>
          <ab id="42001038" type="verse">And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</ab>
          <ab id="42001039" type="verse">And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</ab>
          <ab id="42001040" type="verse">And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</ab>
          <ab id="42001041" type="verse">And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</ab>
          <ab id="42001042" type="verse">And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</ab>
          <ab id="42001043" type="verse">And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</ab>
          <ab id="42001044" type="verse">For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</ab>
          <ab id="42001045" type="verse">And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</ab>
          <ab id="42001046" type="verse">And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</ab>
          <ab id="42001047" type="verse">And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</ab>
          <ab id="42001048" type="verse">For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</ab>
          <ab id="42001049" type="verse">For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</ab>
          <ab id="42001050" type="verse">And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</ab>
          <ab id="42001051" type="verse">He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</ab>
          <ab id="42001052" type="verse">He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</ab>
          <ab id="42001053" type="verse">He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</ab>
          <ab id="42001054" type="verse">He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</ab>
          <ab id="42001055" type="verse">As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</ab>
          <ab id="42001056" type="verse">And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</ab>
          <ab id="42001057" type="verse">Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</ab>
          <ab id="42001058" type="verse">And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</ab>
          <ab id="42001059" type="verse">And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</ab>
          <ab id="42001060" type="verse">And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</ab>
          <ab id="42001061" type="verse">And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</ab>
          <ab id="42001062" type="verse">And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</ab>
          <ab id="42001063" type="verse">And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</ab>
          <ab id="42001064" type="verse">And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.</ab>
          <ab id="42001065" type="verse">And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</ab>
          <ab id="42001066" type="verse">And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</ab>
          <ab id="42001067" type="verse">And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="42001068" type="verse">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</ab>
          <ab id="42001069" type="verse">And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</ab>
          <ab id="42001070" type="verse">As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</ab>
          <ab id="42001071" type="verse">That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</ab>
          <ab id="42001072" type="verse">To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</ab>
          <ab id="42001073" type="verse">The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</ab>
          <ab id="42001074" type="verse">That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</ab>
          <ab id="42001075" type="verse">In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</ab>
          <ab id="42001076" type="verse">And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</ab>
          <ab id="42001077" type="verse">To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</ab>
          <ab id="42001078" type="verse">Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,</ab>
          <ab id="42001079" type="verse">To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</ab>
          <ab id="42001080" type="verse">And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="42002">
          <ab id="42002001" type="verse">And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</ab>
          <ab id="42002002" type="verse">And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</ab>
          <ab id="42002003" type="verse">And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</ab>
          <ab id="42002004" type="verse">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</ab>
          <ab id="42002005" type="verse">To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</ab>
          <ab id="42002006" type="verse">And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</ab>
          <ab id="42002007" type="verse">And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</ab>
          <ab id="42002008" type="verse">And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</ab>
          <ab id="42002009" type="verse">And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</ab>
          <ab id="42002010" type="verse">And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</ab>
          <ab id="42002011" type="verse">For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</ab>
          <ab id="42002012" type="verse">And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</ab>
          <ab id="42002013" type="verse">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</ab>
          <ab id="42002014" type="verse">Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</ab>
          <ab id="42002015" type="verse">And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</ab>
          <ab id="42002016" type="verse">And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</ab>
          <ab id="42002017" type="verse">And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</ab>
          <ab id="42002018" type="verse">And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</ab>
          <ab id="42002019" type="verse">But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</ab>
          <ab id="42002020" type="verse">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="42002021" type="verse">And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</ab>
          <ab id="42002022" type="verse">And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;</ab>
          <ab id="42002023" type="verse">As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</ab>
          <ab id="42002024" type="verse">And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</ab>
          <ab id="42002025" type="verse">And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</ab>
          <ab id="42002026" type="verse">And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</ab>
          <ab id="42002027" type="verse">And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</ab>
          <ab id="42002028" type="verse">Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</ab>
          <ab id="42002029" type="verse">Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:</ab>
          <ab id="42002030" type="verse">For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</ab>
          <ab id="42002031" type="verse">Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</ab>
          <ab id="42002032" type="verse">A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</ab>
          <ab id="42002033" type="verse">And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</ab>
          <ab id="42002034" type="verse">And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</ab>
          <ab id="42002035" type="verse">Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</ab>
          <ab id="42002036" type="verse">And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</ab>
          <ab id="42002037" type="verse">And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</ab>
          <ab id="42002038" type="verse">And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="42002039" type="verse">And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</ab>
          <ab id="42002040" type="verse">And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</ab>
          <ab id="42002041" type="verse">Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</ab>
          <ab id="42002042" type="verse">And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</ab>
          <ab id="42002043" type="verse">And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</ab>
          <ab id="42002044" type="verse">But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</ab>
          <ab id="42002045" type="verse">And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</ab>
          <ab id="42002046" type="verse">And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</ab>
          <ab id="42002047" type="verse">And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</ab>
          <ab id="42002048" type="verse">And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</ab>
          <ab id="42002049" type="verse">And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</ab>
          <ab id="42002050" type="verse">And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="42002051" type="verse">And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</ab>
          <ab id="42002052" type="verse">And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</ab>

          <ab id="42003001" type="verse">Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,</ab>
          <ab id="42003002" type="verse">Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</ab>
          <ab id="42003003" type="verse">And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</ab>
          <ab id="42003004" type="verse">As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</ab>

          <ab id="42008001" type="verse">And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</ab>
          <ab id="42008002" type="verse">And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</ab>

          <ab id="42008004" type="verse">And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</ab>
          <ab id="42008005" type="verse">A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</ab>
          <ab id="42008006" type="verse">And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</ab>
          <ab id="42008007" type="verse">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</ab>
          <ab id="42008008" type="verse">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</ab>
          <ab id="42008009" type="verse">And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</ab>
          <ab id="42008010" type="verse">And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</ab>

          <ab id="42008012" type="verse">Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</ab>
          <ab id="42008013" type="verse">They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</ab>
          <ab id="42008014" type="verse">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</ab>
          <ab id="42008015" type="verse">But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</ab>
          <ab id="42008016" type="verse">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</ab>

          <ab id="42008038" type="verse">Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</ab>

          <ab id="42008045" type="verse">And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</ab>

          <ab id="42009003" type="verse">And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</ab>
          <ab id="42009004" type="verse">And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</ab>
          <ab id="42009005" type="verse">And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</ab>
          <ab id="42009006" type="verse">And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</ab>
          <ab id="42009007" type="verse">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</ab>
          <ab id="42009008" type="verse">And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</ab>
          <ab id="42009009" type="verse">And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</ab>
          <ab id="42009010" type="verse">And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</ab>
          <ab id="42009011" type="verse">And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</ab>
          <ab id="42009012" type="verse">And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</ab>
          <ab id="42009013" type="verse">But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</ab>
          <ab id="42009014" type="verse">For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</ab>
          <ab id="42009015" type="verse">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</ab>
          <ab id="42009016" type="verse">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</ab>
          <ab id="42009017" type="verse">And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</ab>
          <ab id="42009018" type="verse">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</ab>
          <ab id="42009019" type="verse">They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</ab>
          <ab id="42009020" type="verse">He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</ab>
          <ab id="42009021" type="verse">And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;</ab>
          <ab id="42009022" type="verse">Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</ab>
          <ab id="42009023" type="verse">And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</ab>
          <ab id="42009024" type="verse">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</ab>
          <ab id="42009025" type="verse">For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</ab>
          <ab id="42009026" type="verse">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</ab>
          <ab id="42009027" type="verse">But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</ab>
          <ab id="42009028" type="verse">And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</ab>
          <ab id="42009029" type="verse">And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</ab>
          <ab id="42009030" type="verse">And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</ab>
          <ab id="42009031" type="verse">Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="42009032" type="verse">But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</ab>
          <ab id="42009033" type="verse">And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</ab>
          <ab id="42009034" type="verse">While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</ab>
          <ab id="42009035" type="verse">And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</ab>
          <ab id="42009036" type="verse">And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</ab>
          <ab id="42009037" type="verse">And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</ab>
          <ab id="42009038" type="verse">And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</ab>
          <ab id="42009039" type="verse">And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</ab>
          <ab id="42009040" type="verse">And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</ab>
          <ab id="42009041" type="verse">And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</ab>
          <ab id="42009042" type="verse">And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</ab>
          <ab id="42009043" type="verse">And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</ab>
          <ab id="42009044" type="verse">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</ab>
          <ab id="42009045" type="verse">But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</ab>
          <ab id="42009046" type="verse">Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</ab>
          <ab id="42009047" type="verse">And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</ab>
          <ab id="42009048" type="verse">And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</ab>
          <ab id="42009049" type="verse">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</ab>
          <ab id="42009050" type="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</ab>
          <ab id="42009051" type="verse">And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</ab>
          <ab id="42009052" type="verse">And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</ab>
          <ab id="42009053" type="verse">And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="42009054" type="verse">And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</ab>
          <ab id="42009055" type="verse">But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</ab>
          <ab id="42009056" type="verse">For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</ab>
          <ab id="42009057" type="verse">And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</ab>
          <ab id="42009058" type="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</ab>
          <ab id="42009059" type="verse">And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</ab>
          <ab id="42009060" type="verse">Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</ab>
          <ab id="42009061" type="verse">And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</ab>
          <ab id="42009062" type="verse">And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</ab>

          <ab id="42018024" type="verse">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</ab>
          <ab id="42018025" type="verse">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</ab>

          <ab id="42018029" type="verse">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</ab>

          <ab id="42018031" type="verse">Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</ab>
          <ab id="42018032" type="verse">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</ab>

          <ab id="42018035" type="verse">And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</ab>
          <ab id="42018036" type="verse">And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</ab>
          <ab id="42018037" type="verse">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</ab>

          <ab id="42018039" type="verse">And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</ab>
          <ab id="42018040" type="verse">And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</ab>
          <ab id="42018041" type="verse">Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</ab>
          <ab id="42018042" type="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</ab>
          <ab id="42018043" type="verse">And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.</ab>

          <ab id="42019001" type="verse">And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</ab>
          <ab id="42019002" type="verse">And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</ab>
          <ab id="42019003" type="verse">And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</ab>
          <ab id="42019004" type="verse">And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</ab>
          <ab id="42019005" type="verse">And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</ab>
          <ab id="42019006" type="verse">And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</ab>
          <ab id="42019007" type="verse">And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</ab>
          <ab id="42019008" type="verse">And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</ab>
          <ab id="42019009" type="verse">And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</ab>
          <ab id="42019010" type="verse">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</ab>
          <ab id="42019011" type="verse">And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</ab>
          <ab id="42019012" type="verse">He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</ab>
          <ab id="42019013" type="verse">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</ab>
          <ab id="42019014" type="verse">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</ab>
          <ab id="42019015" type="verse">And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</ab>
          <ab id="42019016" type="verse">Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</ab>
          <ab id="42019017" type="verse">And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</ab>
          <ab id="42019018" type="verse">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</ab>
          <ab id="42019019" type="verse">And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</ab>
          <ab id="42019020" type="verse">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</ab>
          <ab id="42019021" type="verse">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</ab>
          <ab id="42019022" type="verse">And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</ab>
          <ab id="42019023" type="verse">Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</ab>
          <ab id="42019024" type="verse">And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</ab>
          <ab id="42019025" type="verse">And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</ab>
          <ab id="42019026" type="verse">For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</ab>
          <ab id="42019027" type="verse">But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</ab>
          <ab id="42019028" type="verse">And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="42019029" type="verse">And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</ab>
          <ab id="42019030" type="verse">Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</ab>
          <ab id="42019031" type="verse">And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</ab>
          <ab id="42019032" type="verse">And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="42019033" type="verse">And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</ab>
          <ab id="42019034" type="verse">And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</ab>
          <ab id="42019035" type="verse">And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</ab>
          <ab id="42019036" type="verse">And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</ab>
          <ab id="42019037" type="verse">And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</ab>
          <ab id="42019038" type="verse">Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</ab>
          <ab id="42019039" type="verse">And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</ab>
          <ab id="42019040" type="verse">And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</ab>
          <ab id="42019041" type="verse">And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</ab>
          <ab id="42019042" type="verse">Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</ab>
          <ab id="42019043" type="verse">For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</ab>
          <ab id="42019044" type="verse">And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</ab>
          <ab id="42019045" type="verse">And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</ab>
          <ab id="42019046" type="verse">Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</ab>
          <ab id="42019047" type="verse">And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</ab>
          <ab id="42019048" type="verse">And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="42020">
          <ab id="42020001" type="verse">And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</ab>
          <ab id="42020002" type="verse">And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</ab>
          <ab id="42020003" type="verse">And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</ab>
          <ab id="42020004" type="verse">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</ab>
          <ab id="42020005" type="verse">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</ab>
          <ab id="42020006" type="verse">But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</ab>
          <ab id="42020007" type="verse">And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</ab>
          <ab id="42020008" type="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</ab>
          <ab id="42020009" type="verse">Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</ab>
          <ab id="42020010" type="verse">And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</ab>
          <ab id="42020011" type="verse">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</ab>
          <ab id="42020012" type="verse">And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</ab>
          <ab id="42020013" type="verse">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</ab>
          <ab id="42020014" type="verse">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</ab>
          <ab id="42020015" type="verse">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</ab>
          <ab id="42020016" type="verse">He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</ab>
          <ab id="42020017" type="verse">And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</ab>
          <ab id="42020018" type="verse">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</ab>
          <ab id="42020019" type="verse">And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</ab>
          <ab id="42020020" type="verse">And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</ab>
          <ab id="42020021" type="verse">And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:</ab>
          <ab id="42020022" type="verse">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</ab>
          <ab id="42020023" type="verse">But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</ab>
          <ab id="42020024" type="verse">Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</ab>
          <ab id="42020025" type="verse">And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</ab>
          <ab id="42020026" type="verse">And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</ab>
          <ab id="42020027" type="verse">Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</ab>
          <ab id="42020028" type="verse">Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</ab>
          <ab id="42020029" type="verse">There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</ab>
          <ab id="42020030" type="verse">And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</ab>
          <ab id="42020031" type="verse">And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</ab>
          <ab id="42020032" type="verse">Last of all the woman died also.</ab>
          <ab id="42020033" type="verse">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</ab>
          <ab id="42020034" type="verse">And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</ab>
          <ab id="42020035" type="verse">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</ab>
          <ab id="42020036" type="verse">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</ab>
          <ab id="42020037" type="verse">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</ab>
          <ab id="42020038" type="verse">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</ab>
          <ab id="42020039" type="verse">Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</ab>
          <ab id="42020040" type="verse">And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</ab>
          <ab id="42020041" type="verse">And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</ab>
          <ab id="42020042" type="verse">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</ab>
          <ab id="42020043" type="verse">Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</ab>
          <ab id="42020044" type="verse">David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</ab>
          <ab id="42020045" type="verse">Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</ab>
          <ab id="42020046" type="verse">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</ab>
          <ab id="42020047" type="verse">Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.</ab>

          <ab id="42021003" type="verse">And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</ab>

          <ab id="42022002" type="verse">And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</ab>
          <ab id="42022003" type="verse">Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</ab>
          <ab id="42022004" type="verse">And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.</ab>

          <ab id="42022006" type="verse">And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</ab>
          <ab id="42022007" type="verse">Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</ab>

          <ab id="42022040" type="verse">And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</ab>
          <ab id="42022041" type="verse">And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</ab>
          <ab id="42022042" type="verse">Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</ab>
          <ab id="42022043" type="verse">And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</ab>
          <ab id="42022044" type="verse">And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</ab>

          <ab id="42022046" type="verse">And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</ab>
          <ab id="42022047" type="verse">And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</ab>
          <ab id="42022048" type="verse">But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</ab>
          <ab id="42022049" type="verse">When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</ab>
          <ab id="42022050" type="verse">And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</ab>
          <ab id="42022051" type="verse">And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</ab>
          <ab id="42022052" type="verse">Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</ab>
          <ab id="42022053" type="verse">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</ab>
          <ab id="42022054" type="verse">Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</ab>
          <ab id="42022055" type="verse">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</ab>
          <ab id="42022056" type="verse">But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</ab>
          <ab id="42022057" type="verse">And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</ab>
          <ab id="42022058" type="verse">And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</ab>
          <ab id="42022059" type="verse">And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</ab>
          <ab id="42022060" type="verse">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</ab>
          <ab id="42022061" type="verse">And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</ab>
          <ab id="42022062" type="verse">And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</ab>
          <ab id="42022063" type="verse">And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</ab>
          <ab id="42022064" type="verse">And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</ab>
          <ab id="42022065" type="verse">And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</ab>
          <ab id="42022066" type="verse">And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="42022067" type="verse">Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</ab>
          <ab id="42022068" type="verse">And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</ab>
          <ab id="42022069" type="verse">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</ab>
          <ab id="42022070" type="verse">Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</ab>

          <ab id="42023001" type="verse">And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</ab>
          <ab id="42023002" type="verse">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</ab>
          <ab id="42023003" type="verse">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</ab>
          <ab id="42023004" type="verse">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</ab>
          <ab id="42023005" type="verse">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</ab>
          <ab id="42023006" type="verse">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</ab>
          <ab id="42023007" type="verse">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</ab>
          <ab id="42023008" type="verse">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</ab>
          <ab id="42023009" type="verse">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</ab>
          <ab id="42023010" type="verse">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</ab>
          <ab id="42023011" type="verse">And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</ab>
          <ab id="42023012" type="verse">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</ab>
          <ab id="42023013" type="verse">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</ab>
          <ab id="42023014" type="verse">Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</ab>
          <ab id="42023015" type="verse">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</ab>
          <ab id="42023016" type="verse">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</ab>
          <ab id="42023017" type="verse">For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</ab>
          <ab id="42023018" type="verse">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</ab>
          <ab id="42023019" type="verse">Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</ab>
          <ab id="42023020" type="verse">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</ab>
          <ab id="42023021" type="verse">But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</ab>
          <ab id="42023022" type="verse">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</ab>
          <ab id="42023023" type="verse">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</ab>
          <ab id="42023024" type="verse">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</ab>
          <ab id="42023025" type="verse">And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</ab>
          <ab id="42023026" type="verse">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</ab>
          <ab id="42023027" type="verse">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</ab>
          <ab id="42023028" type="verse">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</ab>
          <ab id="42023029" type="verse">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</ab>
          <ab id="42023030" type="verse">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</ab>

          <ab id="42023032" type="verse">And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</ab>
          <ab id="42023033" type="verse">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</ab>
          <ab id="42023034" type="verse">Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</ab>
          <ab id="42023035" type="verse">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</ab>
          <ab id="42023036" type="verse">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</ab>
          <ab id="42023037" type="verse">And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</ab>
          <ab id="42023038" type="verse">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</ab>
          <ab id="42023039" type="verse">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</ab>
          <ab id="42023040" type="verse">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</ab>
          <ab id="42023041" type="verse">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</ab>
          <ab id="42023042" type="verse">And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</ab>
          <ab id="42023043" type="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</ab>
          <ab id="42023044" type="verse">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</ab>

          <ab id="42023046" type="verse">And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</ab>
          <ab id="42023047" type="verse">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</ab>

          <ab id="42023052" type="verse">This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</ab>
          <ab id="42023053" type="verse">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</ab>

          <ab id="42024014" type="verse">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</ab>
          <ab id="42024015" type="verse">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</ab>
          <ab id="42024016" type="verse">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</ab>
          <ab id="42024017" type="verse">And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</ab>

          <ab id="42024024" type="verse">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</ab>
          <ab id="42024025" type="verse">Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</ab>
          <ab id="42024026" type="verse">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</ab>
          <ab id="42024027" type="verse">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</ab>

          <ab id="42024030" type="verse">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</ab>
          <ab id="42024031" type="verse">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</ab>
          <ab id="42024032" type="verse">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</ab>
          <ab id="42024033" type="verse">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</ab>
          <ab id="42024034" type="verse">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</ab>
          <ab id="42024035" type="verse">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</ab>
          <ab id="42024036" type="verse">And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</ab>
          <ab id="42024037" type="verse">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</ab>
          <ab id="42024038" type="verse">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</ab>
          <ab id="42024039" type="verse">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</ab>
          <ab id="42024040" type="verse">And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</ab>
          <ab id="42024041" type="verse">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</ab>
          <ab id="42024042" type="verse">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</ab>
          <ab id="42024043" type="verse">And he took it, and did eat before them.</ab>
          <ab id="42024044" type="verse">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</ab>
          <ab id="42024045" type="verse">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</ab>
          <ab id="42024046" type="verse">And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</ab>
          <ab id="42024047" type="verse">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</ab>

          <ab id="42024049" type="verse">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</ab>
          <ab id="42024050" type="verse">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</ab>
          <ab id="42024051" type="verse">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</ab>
          <ab id="42024052" type="verse">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</ab>
          <ab id="42024053" type="verse">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</ab>
