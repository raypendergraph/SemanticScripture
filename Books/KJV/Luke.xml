        <fragment id="42001001" kind="vs">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001002" kind="vs">Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001003" kind="vs">It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001004" kind="vs">That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001005" kind="vs">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001006" kind="vs">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001007" kind="vs">And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001008" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001009" kind="vs">According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001010" kind="vs">And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001011" kind="vs">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001012" kind="vs">And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001013" kind="vs">But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001014" kind="vs">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001015" kind="vs">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001016" kind="vs">And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001017" kind="vs">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001018" kind="vs">And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001019" kind="vs">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001020" kind="vs">And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001021" kind="vs">And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001022" kind="vs">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001023" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001024" kind="vs">And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001025" kind="vs">Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001026" kind="vs">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001027" kind="vs">To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001028" kind="vs">And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001029" kind="vs">And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001030" kind="vs">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001031" kind="vs">And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001032" kind="vs">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001033" kind="vs">And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001034" kind="vs">Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001035" kind="vs">And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001036" kind="vs">And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001037" kind="vs">For with God nothing shall be impossible.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001038" kind="vs">And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001039" kind="vs">And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001040" kind="vs">And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001041" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001042" kind="vs">And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001043" kind="vs">And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001044" kind="vs">For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001045" kind="vs">And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001046" kind="vs">And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001047" kind="vs">And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001048" kind="vs">For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001049" kind="vs">For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001050" kind="vs">And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001051" kind="vs">He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001052" kind="vs">He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001053" kind="vs">He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001054" kind="vs">He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001055" kind="vs">As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001056" kind="vs">And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001057" kind="vs">Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001058" kind="vs">And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001059" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001060" kind="vs">And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001061" kind="vs">And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001062" kind="vs">And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001063" kind="vs">And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001064" kind="vs">And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001065" kind="vs">And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001066" kind="vs">And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001067" kind="vs">And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001068" kind="vs">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001069" kind="vs">And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001070" kind="vs">As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001071" kind="vs">That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001072" kind="vs">To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001073" kind="vs">The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001074" kind="vs">That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001075" kind="vs">In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001076" kind="vs">And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001077" kind="vs">To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001078" kind="vs">Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001079" kind="vs">To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42001080" kind="vs">And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</fragment>

        <fragment id="42002001" kind="vs">And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002002" kind="vs">And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002003" kind="vs">And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002004" kind="vs">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002005" kind="vs">To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002006" kind="vs">And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002007" kind="vs">And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002008" kind="vs">And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002009" kind="vs">And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002010" kind="vs">And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002011" kind="vs">For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002012" kind="vs">And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002013" kind="vs">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002014" kind="vs">Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002015" kind="vs">And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002016" kind="vs">And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002017" kind="vs">And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002018" kind="vs">And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002019" kind="vs">But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002020" kind="vs">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002021" kind="vs">And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002022" kind="vs">And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002023" kind="vs">As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002024" kind="vs">And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002025" kind="vs">And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002026" kind="vs">And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002027" kind="vs">And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002028" kind="vs">Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002029" kind="vs">Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002030" kind="vs">For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002031" kind="vs">Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002032" kind="vs">A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002033" kind="vs">And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002034" kind="vs">And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002035" kind="vs">Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002036" kind="vs">And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002037" kind="vs">And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002038" kind="vs">And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002039" kind="vs">And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002040" kind="vs">And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002041" kind="vs">Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002042" kind="vs">And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002043" kind="vs">And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002044" kind="vs">But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002045" kind="vs">And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002046" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002047" kind="vs">And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002048" kind="vs">And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002049" kind="vs">And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002050" kind="vs">And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002051" kind="vs">And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42002052" kind="vs">And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</fragment>

        <fragment id="42009018" kind="vs">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</fragment>

        <fragment id="42009028" kind="vs">And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009029" kind="vs">And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009030" kind="vs">And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009031" kind="vs">Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009032" kind="vs">But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009033" kind="vs">And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009034" kind="vs">While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009035" kind="vs">And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009036" kind="vs">And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009037" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009038" kind="vs">And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009039" kind="vs">And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009040" kind="vs">And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009041" kind="vs">And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009042" kind="vs">And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009043" kind="vs">And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009044" kind="vs">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009045" kind="vs">But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009046" kind="vs">Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009047" kind="vs">And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009048" kind="vs">And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009049" kind="vs">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009050" kind="vs">And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009051" kind="vs">And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009052" kind="vs">And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009053" kind="vs">And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009054" kind="vs">And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009055" kind="vs">But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009056" kind="vs">For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009057" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009058" kind="vs">And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009059" kind="vs">And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009060" kind="vs">Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009061" kind="vs">And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</fragment>
        <fragment id="42009062" kind="vs">And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</fragment>
