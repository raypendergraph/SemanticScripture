        <fragment id="54001002" kind="vs">Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001003" kind="vs">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001004" kind="vs">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001005" kind="vs">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001006" kind="vs">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001007" kind="vs">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001008" kind="vs">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001009" kind="vs">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001010" kind="vs">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001011" kind="vs">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001012" kind="vs">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001013" kind="vs">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001014" kind="vs">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001015" kind="vs">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001016" kind="vs">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001017" kind="vs">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</fragment>

        <fragment id="54001019" kind="vs">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</fragment>
        <fragment id="54001020" kind="vs">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</fragment>

        <fragment id="54002003" kind="vs">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002004" kind="vs">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002005" kind="vs">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002006" kind="vs">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002007" kind="vs">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002008" kind="vs">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002009" kind="vs">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002010" kind="vs">But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002011" kind="vs">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002012" kind="vs">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002013" kind="vs">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54002014" kind="vs">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</fragment>

        <fragment id="54003001" kind="vs">This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003002" kind="vs">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003003" kind="vs">Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003004" kind="vs">One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003005" kind="vs">For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003006" kind="vs">Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003007" kind="vs">Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003008" kind="vs">Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003009" kind="vs">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003010" kind="vs">And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003011" kind="vs">Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003012" kind="vs">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003013" kind="vs">For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003014" kind="vs">These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003015" kind="vs">But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54003016" kind="vs">And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</fragment>

        <fragment id="54004003" kind="vs">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</fragment>

        <fragment id="54004006" kind="vs">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54004007" kind="vs">But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="54004008" kind="vs">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</fragment>

        <fragment id="54004010" kind="vs">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</fragment>
