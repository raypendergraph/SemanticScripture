        <fragment id="62002001" kind="vs">My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002002" kind="vs">And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002003" kind="vs">And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002004" kind="vs">He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002005" kind="vs">But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002006" kind="vs">He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002007" kind="vs">Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002008" kind="vs">Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002009" kind="vs">He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002010" kind="vs">He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002011" kind="vs">But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002012" kind="vs">I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002013" kind="vs">I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002014" kind="vs">I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002015" kind="vs">Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</fragment>

        <fragment id="62002018" kind="vs">Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002019" kind="vs">They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002020" kind="vs">But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002021" kind="vs">I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002022" kind="vs">Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.</fragment>

        <fragment id="62002024" kind="vs">Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002025" kind="vs">And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002026" kind="vs">These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002027" kind="vs">But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002028" kind="vs">And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62002029" kind="vs">If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.</fragment>

        <fragment id="62003008" kind="vs">He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</fragment>

        <fragment id="62003010" kind="vs">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</fragment>

        <fragment id="62003012" kind="vs">Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003013" kind="vs">Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003014" kind="vs">We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</fragment>

        <fragment id="62003016" kind="vs">Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003017" kind="vs">But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003018" kind="vs">My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003019" kind="vs">And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003020" kind="vs">For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003021" kind="vs">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003022" kind="vs">And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003023" kind="vs">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</fragment>
        <fragment id="62003024" kind="vs">And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</fragment>
