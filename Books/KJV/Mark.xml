          <ab id="41001001" type="verse">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</ab>
          <ab id="41001002" type="verse">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</ab>
          <ab id="41001003" type="verse">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</ab>
          <ab id="41001004" type="verse">John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</ab>
          <ab id="41001005" type="verse">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</ab>
          <ab id="41001006" type="verse">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</ab>
          <ab id="41001007" type="verse">And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</ab>
          <ab id="41001008" type="verse">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</ab>
          <ab id="41001009" type="verse">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</ab>
          <ab id="41001010" type="verse">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</ab>
          <ab id="41001011" type="verse">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</ab>
          <ab id="41001012" type="verse">And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</ab>
          <ab id="41001013" type="verse">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001014" type="verse">Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</ab>
          <ab id="41001015" type="verse">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</ab>
          <ab id="41001016" type="verse">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</ab>
          <ab id="41001017" type="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</ab>
          <ab id="41001018" type="verse">And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001019" type="verse">And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</ab>
          <ab id="41001020" type="verse">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001021" type="verse">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</ab>
          <ab id="41001022" type="verse">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</ab>
          <ab id="41001023" type="verse">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</ab>
          <ab id="41001024" type="verse">Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</ab>
          <ab id="41001025" type="verse">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001026" type="verse">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001027" type="verse">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001028" type="verse">And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</ab>
          <ab id="41001029" type="verse">And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</ab>
          <ab id="41001030" type="verse">But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</ab>
          <ab id="41001031" type="verse">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="41001032" type="verse">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</ab>
          <ab id="41001033" type="verse">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</ab>
          <ab id="41001034" type="verse">And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001035" type="verse">And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</ab>
          <ab id="41001036" type="verse">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</ab>
          <ab id="41001037" type="verse">And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</ab>
          <ab id="41001038" type="verse">And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</ab>
          <ab id="41001039" type="verse">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</ab>
          <ab id="41001040" type="verse">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</ab>
          <ab id="41001041" type="verse">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</ab>
          <ab id="41001042" type="verse">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</ab>
          <ab id="41001043" type="verse">And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</ab>
          <ab id="41001044" type="verse">And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="41001045" type="verse">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" id="41002">
          <ab id="41002001" type="verse">And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</ab>
          <ab id="41002002" type="verse">And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="41002003" type="verse">And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</ab>
          <ab id="41002004" type="verse">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</ab>
          <ab id="41002005" type="verse">When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</ab>
          <ab id="41002006" type="verse">But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</ab>
          <ab id="41002007" type="verse">Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</ab>
          <ab id="41002008" type="verse">And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</ab>
          <ab id="41002009" type="verse">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</ab>
          <ab id="41002010" type="verse">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</ab>
          <ab id="41002011" type="verse">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</ab>
          <ab id="41002012" type="verse">And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</ab>
          <ab id="41002013" type="verse">And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</ab>
          <ab id="41002014" type="verse">And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</ab>
          <ab id="41002015" type="verse">And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</ab>
          <ab id="41002016" type="verse">And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</ab>
          <ab id="41002017" type="verse">When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</ab>
          <ab id="41002018" type="verse">And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</ab>
          <ab id="41002019" type="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</ab>
          <ab id="41002020" type="verse">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</ab>
          <ab id="41002021" type="verse">No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</ab>
          <ab id="41002022" type="verse">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</ab>
          <ab id="41002023" type="verse">And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</ab>
          <ab id="41002024" type="verse">And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</ab>
          <ab id="41002025" type="verse">And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</ab>
          <ab id="41002026" type="verse">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</ab>
          <ab id="41002027" type="verse">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</ab>
          <ab id="41002028" type="verse">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" id="41003">
          <ab id="41003001" type="verse">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</ab>
          <ab id="41003002" type="verse">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</ab>
          <ab id="41003003" type="verse">And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</ab>
          <ab id="41003004" type="verse">And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</ab>
          <ab id="41003005" type="verse">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</ab>
          <ab id="41003006" type="verse">And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</ab>
          <ab id="41003007" type="verse">But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</ab>
          <ab id="41003008" type="verse">And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</ab>
          <ab id="41003009" type="verse">And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</ab>
          <ab id="41003010" type="verse">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</ab>
          <ab id="41003011" type="verse">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</ab>
          <ab id="41003012" type="verse">And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</ab>
          <ab id="41003013" type="verse">And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</ab>
          <ab id="41003014" type="verse">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</ab>
          <ab id="41003015" type="verse">And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</ab>
          <ab id="41003016" type="verse">And Simon he surnamed Peter;</ab>
          <ab id="41003017" type="verse">And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</ab>
          <ab id="41003018" type="verse">And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</ab>
          <ab id="41003019" type="verse">And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</ab>
          <ab id="41003020" type="verse">And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</ab>
          <ab id="41003021" type="verse">And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</ab>
          <ab id="41003022" type="verse">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</ab>
          <ab id="41003023" type="verse">And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</ab>
          <ab id="41003024" type="verse">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</ab>
          <ab id="41003025" type="verse">And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</ab>
          <ab id="41003026" type="verse">And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</ab>
          <ab id="41003027" type="verse">No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</ab>
          <ab id="41003028" type="verse">Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</ab>
          <ab id="41003029" type="verse">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</ab>
          <ab id="41003030" type="verse">Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</ab>
          <ab id="41003031" type="verse">There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</ab>
          <ab id="41003032" type="verse">And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</ab>
          <ab id="41003033" type="verse">And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</ab>
          <ab id="41003034" type="verse">And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</ab>
          <ab id="41003035" type="verse">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" id="41004">
          <ab id="41004001" type="verse">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</ab>
          <ab id="41004002" type="verse">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</ab>
          <ab id="41004003" type="verse">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</ab>
          <ab id="41004004" type="verse">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</ab>
          <ab id="41004005" type="verse">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</ab>
          <ab id="41004006" type="verse">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</ab>
          <ab id="41004007" type="verse">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</ab>
          <ab id="41004008" type="verse">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</ab>
          <ab id="41004009" type="verse">And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</ab>
          <ab id="41004010" type="verse">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</ab>
          <ab id="41004011" type="verse">And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</ab>
          <ab id="41004012" type="verse">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</ab>
          <ab id="41004013" type="verse">And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</ab>
          <ab id="41004014" type="verse">The sower soweth the word.</ab>
          <ab id="41004015" type="verse">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</ab>
          <ab id="41004016" type="verse">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</ab>
          <ab id="41004017" type="verse">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</ab>
          <ab id="41004018" type="verse">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</ab>
          <ab id="41004019" type="verse">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</ab>
          <ab id="41004020" type="verse">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</ab>
          <ab id="41004021" type="verse">And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</ab>
          <ab id="41004022" type="verse">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</ab>
          <ab id="41004023" type="verse">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</ab>
          <ab id="41004024" type="verse">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</ab>
          <ab id="41004025" type="verse">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</ab>
          <ab id="41004026" type="verse">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</ab>
          <ab id="41004027" type="verse">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</ab>
          <ab id="41004028" type="verse">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</ab>
          <ab id="41004029" type="verse">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</ab>
          <ab id="41004030" type="verse">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</ab>
          <ab id="41004031" type="verse">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</ab>
          <ab id="41004032" type="verse">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</ab>

          <ab id="41008001" type="verse">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</ab>
          <ab id="41008002" type="verse">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</ab>
          <ab id="41008003" type="verse">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</ab>
          <ab id="41008004" type="verse">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</ab>
          <ab id="41008005" type="verse">And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</ab>
          <ab id="41008006" type="verse">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</ab>
          <ab id="41008007" type="verse">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</ab>
          <ab id="41008008" type="verse">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</ab>
          <ab id="41008009" type="verse">And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</ab>
          <ab id="41008010" type="verse">And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</ab>
          <ab id="41008011" type="verse">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</ab>
          <ab id="41008012" type="verse">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</ab>
          <ab id="41008013" type="verse">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</ab>
          <ab id="41008014" type="verse">Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</ab>
          <ab id="41008015" type="verse">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</ab>
          <ab id="41008016" type="verse">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</ab>
          <ab id="41008017" type="verse">And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</ab>

          <ab id="41008019" type="verse">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</ab>
          <ab id="41008020" type="verse">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</ab>
          <ab id="41008021" type="verse">And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</ab>
          <ab id="41008022" type="verse">And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</ab>
          <ab id="41008023" type="verse">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</ab>
          <ab id="41008024" type="verse">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</ab>
          <ab id="41008025" type="verse">After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</ab>
          <ab id="41008026" type="verse">And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</ab>
          <ab id="41008027" type="verse">And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</ab>

          <ab id="41008029" type="verse">And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</ab>
          <ab id="41008030" type="verse">And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</ab>
          <ab id="41008031" type="verse">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</ab>
          <ab id="41008032" type="verse">And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</ab>
          <ab id="41008033" type="verse">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</ab>
          <ab id="41008034" type="verse">And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</ab>
          <ab id="41008035" type="verse">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</ab>
          <ab id="41008036" type="verse">For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</ab>
          <ab id="41008037" type="verse">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</ab>
          <ab id="41008038" type="verse">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</ab>

          <ab id="41014014" type="verse">And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</ab>
          <ab id="41014015" type="verse">And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</ab>
          <ab id="41014016" type="verse">And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</ab>
          <ab id="41014017" type="verse">And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</ab>
          <ab id="41014018" type="verse">And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</ab>
          <ab id="41014019" type="verse">And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</ab>
          <ab id="41014020" type="verse">And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</ab>
          <ab id="41014021" type="verse">The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</ab>
          <ab id="41014022" type="verse">And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</ab>
          <ab id="41014023" type="verse">And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</ab>
          <ab id="41014024" type="verse">And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</ab>
          <ab id="41014025" type="verse">Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</ab>
          <ab id="41014026" type="verse">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</ab>
          <ab id="41014027" type="verse">And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</ab>
          <ab id="41014028" type="verse">But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</ab>
          <ab id="41014029" type="verse">But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</ab>
          <ab id="41014030" type="verse">And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</ab>
          <ab id="41014031" type="verse">But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</ab>
          <ab id="41014032" type="verse">And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</ab>
          <ab id="41014033" type="verse">And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</ab>
          <ab id="41014034" type="verse">And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</ab>
          <ab id="41014035" type="verse">And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</ab>
          <ab id="41014036" type="verse">And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</ab>
          <ab id="41014037" type="verse">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</ab>
          <ab id="41014038" type="verse">Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</ab>
          <ab id="41014039" type="verse">And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</ab>
          <ab id="41014040" type="verse">And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</ab>
          <ab id="41014041" type="verse">And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</ab>
          <ab id="41014042" type="verse">Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</ab>
          <ab id="41014043" type="verse">And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</ab>
          <ab id="41014044" type="verse">And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</ab>
          <ab id="41014045" type="verse">And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</ab>
          <ab id="41014046" type="verse">And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</ab>
          <ab id="41014047" type="verse">And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</ab>
          <ab id="41014048" type="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</ab>
          <ab id="41014049" type="verse">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</ab>
          <ab id="41014050" type="verse">And they all forsook him, and fled.</ab>
          <ab id="41014051" type="verse">And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</ab>
          <ab id="41014052" type="verse">And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</ab>
          <ab id="41014053" type="verse">And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</ab>
          <ab id="41014054" type="verse">And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</ab>
          <ab id="41014055" type="verse">And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</ab>
          <ab id="41014056" type="verse">For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</ab>
          <ab id="41014057" type="verse">And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</ab>
          <ab id="41014058" type="verse">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</ab>
          <ab id="41014059" type="verse">But neither so did their witness agree together.</ab>
          <ab id="41014060" type="verse">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</ab>
          <ab id="41014061" type="verse">But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</ab>
          <ab id="41014062" type="verse">And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</ab>
          <ab id="41014063" type="verse">Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</ab>
          <ab id="41014064" type="verse">Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</ab>
          <ab id="41014065" type="verse">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</ab>
          <ab id="41014066" type="verse">And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</ab>
          <ab id="41014067" type="verse">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</ab>
          <ab id="41014068" type="verse">But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</ab>
          <ab id="41014069" type="verse">And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</ab>
          <ab id="41014070" type="verse">And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</ab>
          <ab id="41014071" type="verse">But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</ab>
          <ab id="41014072" type="verse">And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</ab>

        <div type="chapter" id="41015">
          <ab id="41015001" type="verse">And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</ab>
          <ab id="41015002" type="verse">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</ab>
          <ab id="41015003" type="verse">And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</ab>
          <ab id="41015004" type="verse">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</ab>
          <ab id="41015005" type="verse">But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</ab>
          <ab id="41015006" type="verse">Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</ab>
          <ab id="41015007" type="verse">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</ab>
          <ab id="41015008" type="verse">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="41015009" type="verse">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</ab>
          <ab id="41015010" type="verse">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</ab>
          <ab id="41015011" type="verse">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</ab>
          <ab id="41015012" type="verse">And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</ab>
          <ab id="41015013" type="verse">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</ab>
          <ab id="41015014" type="verse">Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</ab>
          <ab id="41015015" type="verse">And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</ab>
          <ab id="41015016" type="verse">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</ab>
          <ab id="41015017" type="verse">And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</ab>
          <ab id="41015018" type="verse">And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</ab>
          <ab id="41015019" type="verse">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</ab>
          <ab id="41015020" type="verse">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</ab>
          <ab id="41015021" type="verse">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</ab>
          <ab id="41015022" type="verse">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</ab>
          <ab id="41015023" type="verse">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</ab>
          <ab id="41015024" type="verse">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</ab>
          <ab id="41015025" type="verse">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</ab>
          <ab id="41015026" type="verse">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</ab>
          <ab id="41015027" type="verse">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</ab>
          <ab id="41015028" type="verse">And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</ab>
          <ab id="41015029" type="verse">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</ab>
          <ab id="41015030" type="verse">Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</ab>
          <ab id="41015031" type="verse">Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</ab>
          <ab id="41015032" type="verse">Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</ab>
          <ab id="41015033" type="verse">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</ab>
          <ab id="41015034" type="verse">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</ab>
          <ab id="41015035" type="verse">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</ab>
          <ab id="41015036" type="verse">And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</ab>
          <ab id="41015037" type="verse">And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</ab>
          <ab id="41015038" type="verse">And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</ab>
          <ab id="41015039" type="verse">And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</ab>
          <ab id="41015040" type="verse">There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</ab>
          <ab id="41015041" type="verse">Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</ab>
          <ab id="41015042" type="verse">And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</ab>
          <ab id="41015043" type="verse">Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</ab>
          <ab id="41015044" type="verse">And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</ab>
          <ab id="41015045" type="verse">And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</ab>
          <ab id="41015046" type="verse">And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</ab>
          <ab id="41015047" type="verse">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</ab>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" id="41016">
          <ab id="41016001" type="verse">And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</ab>
          <ab id="41016002" type="verse">And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</ab>
          <ab id="41016003" type="verse">And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</ab>
          <ab id="41016004" type="verse">And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</ab>
          <ab id="41016005" type="verse">And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</ab>
          <ab id="41016006" type="verse">And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</ab>
          <ab id="41016007" type="verse">But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</ab>
          <ab id="41016008" type="verse">And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</ab>
          <ab id="41016009" type="verse">Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</ab>
          <ab id="41016010" type="verse">And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</ab>
          <ab id="41016011" type="verse">And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</ab>
          <ab id="41016012" type="verse">After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</ab>
          <ab id="41016013" type="verse">And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</ab>
          <ab id="41016014" type="verse">Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</ab>
          <ab id="41016015" type="verse">And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</ab>
          <ab id="41016016" type="verse">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</ab>
          <ab id="41016017" type="verse">And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</ab>
          <ab id="41016018" type="verse">They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</ab>
          <ab id="41016019" type="verse">So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</ab>
          <ab id="41016020" type="verse">And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</ab>
