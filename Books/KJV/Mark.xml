        <fragment id="41001001" kind="vs">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001002" kind="vs">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001003" kind="vs">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001004" kind="vs">John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001005" kind="vs">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001006" kind="vs">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001007" kind="vs">And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001008" kind="vs">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001009" kind="vs">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001010" kind="vs">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001011" kind="vs">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001012" kind="vs">And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001013" kind="vs">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001014" kind="vs">Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001015" kind="vs">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001016" kind="vs">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001017" kind="vs">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001018" kind="vs">And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001019" kind="vs">And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001020" kind="vs">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001021" kind="vs">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001022" kind="vs">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001023" kind="vs">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001024" kind="vs">Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001025" kind="vs">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001026" kind="vs">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001027" kind="vs">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001028" kind="vs">And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001029" kind="vs">And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001030" kind="vs">But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001031" kind="vs">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001032" kind="vs">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001033" kind="vs">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001034" kind="vs">And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001035" kind="vs">And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001036" kind="vs">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001037" kind="vs">And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001038" kind="vs">And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001039" kind="vs">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001040" kind="vs">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001041" kind="vs">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001042" kind="vs">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001043" kind="vs">And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001044" kind="vs">And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41001045" kind="vs">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41002001" kind="vs">And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002002" kind="vs">And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002003" kind="vs">And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002004" kind="vs">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002005" kind="vs">When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002006" kind="vs">But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002007" kind="vs">Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002008" kind="vs">And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002009" kind="vs">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002010" kind="vs">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002011" kind="vs">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002012" kind="vs">And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002013" kind="vs">And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002014" kind="vs">And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002015" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002016" kind="vs">And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002017" kind="vs">When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002018" kind="vs">And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002019" kind="vs">And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002020" kind="vs">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002021" kind="vs">No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002022" kind="vs">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002023" kind="vs">And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002024" kind="vs">And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002025" kind="vs">And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002026" kind="vs">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41002027" kind="vs">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</fragment>

        <fragment id="41003003" kind="vs">And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41003004" kind="vs">And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41003005" kind="vs">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41003006" kind="vs">And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41003007" kind="vs">But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</fragment>

        <fragment id="41003010" kind="vs">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41003011" kind="vs">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41003013" kind="vs">And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41003014" kind="vs">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</fragment>

        <fragment id="41014031" kind="vs">But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014032" kind="vs">And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41014034" kind="vs">And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014035" kind="vs">And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014036" kind="vs">And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014037" kind="vs">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014038" kind="vs">Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014039" kind="vs">And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014040" kind="vs">And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014041" kind="vs">And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014042" kind="vs">Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014043" kind="vs">And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41014047" kind="vs">And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014048" kind="vs">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014049" kind="vs">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014050" kind="vs">And they all forsook him, and fled.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014051" kind="vs">And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</fragment>

        <fragment id="41014053" kind="vs">And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014054" kind="vs">And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014055" kind="vs">And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41014057" kind="vs">And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014058" kind="vs">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014059" kind="vs">But neither so did their witness agree together.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014060" kind="vs">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014061" kind="vs">But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014062" kind="vs">And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014063" kind="vs">Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014064" kind="vs">Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014065" kind="vs">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014066" kind="vs">And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014067" kind="vs">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014068" kind="vs">But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014069" kind="vs">And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014070" kind="vs">And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014071" kind="vs">But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41014072" kind="vs">And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41015006" kind="vs">Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41015007" kind="vs">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41015008" kind="vs">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41015011" kind="vs">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41015019" kind="vs">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41015020" kind="vs">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41015021" kind="vs">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</fragment>

        <fragment id="41015026" kind="vs">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41015027" kind="vs">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41015028" kind="vs">And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</fragment>
        <fragment id="41015029" kind="vs">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</fragment>
