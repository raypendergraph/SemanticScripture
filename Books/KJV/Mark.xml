    <chapter id="41001">
      <block id="41001001" type="v">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</block>
      <block id="41001002" type="v">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</block>
      <block id="41001003" type="v">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</block>
      <block id="41001004" type="v">John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</block>
      <block id="41001005" type="v">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</block>
      <block id="41001006" type="v">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</block>
      <block id="41001007" type="v">And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</block>
      <block id="41001008" type="v">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</block>
      <block id="41001009" type="v">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</block>
      <block id="41001010" type="v">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</block>
      <block id="41001011" type="v">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</block>
      <block id="41001012" type="v">And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</block>
      <block id="41001013" type="v">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</block>
      <block id="41001014" type="v">Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</block>
      <block id="41001015" type="v">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</block>
      <block id="41001016" type="v">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</block>
      <block id="41001017" type="v">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</block>
      <block id="41001018" type="v">And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</block>
      <block id="41001019" type="v">And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</block>
      <block id="41001020" type="v">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</block>
      <block id="41001021" type="v">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</block>
      <block id="41001022" type="v">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</block>
      <block id="41001023" type="v">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</block>
      <block id="41001024" type="v">Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</block>
      <block id="41001025" type="v">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</block>
      <block id="41001026" type="v">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</block>
      <block id="41001027" type="v">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</block>
      <block id="41001028" type="v">And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</block>
      <block id="41001029" type="v">And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</block>
      <block id="41001030" type="v">But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</block>
      <block id="41001031" type="v">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</block>
      <block id="41001032" type="v">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</block>
      <block id="41001033" type="v">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</block>
      <block id="41001034" type="v">And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</block>
      <block id="41001035" type="v">And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</block>
      <block id="41001036" type="v">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</block>
      <block id="41001037" type="v">And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</block>
      <block id="41001038" type="v">And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</block>
      <block id="41001039" type="v">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</block>
      <block id="41001040" type="v">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</block>
      <block id="41001041" type="v">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</block>
      <block id="41001042" type="v">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</block>
      <block id="41001043" type="v">And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</block>
      <block id="41001044" type="v">And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</block>
      <block id="41001045" type="v">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="41002">
      <block id="41002001" type="v">And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</block>
      <block id="41002002" type="v">And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</block>
      <block id="41002003" type="v">And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</block>
      <block id="41002004" type="v">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</block>
      <block id="41002005" type="v">When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</block>
      <block id="41002006" type="v">But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</block>
      <block id="41002007" type="v">Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</block>
      <block id="41002008" type="v">And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</block>
      <block id="41002009" type="v">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</block>
      <block id="41002010" type="v">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</block>
      <block id="41002011" type="v">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</block>
      <block id="41002012" type="v">And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</block>
      <block id="41002013" type="v">And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</block>
      <block id="41002014" type="v">And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</block>
      <block id="41002015" type="v">And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</block>
      <block id="41002016" type="v">And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</block>
      <block id="41002017" type="v">When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</block>
      <block id="41002018" type="v">And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</block>
      <block id="41002019" type="v">And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</block>
      <block id="41002020" type="v">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</block>
      <block id="41002021" type="v">No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</block>
      <block id="41002022" type="v">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</block>
      <block id="41002023" type="v">And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</block>
      <block id="41002024" type="v">And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</block>
      <block id="41002025" type="v">And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</block>
      <block id="41002026" type="v">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</block>
      <block id="41002027" type="v">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</block>
      <block id="41002028" type="v">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="41003">
      <block id="41003001" type="v">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</block>
      <block id="41003002" type="v">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</block>
      <block id="41003003" type="v">And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</block>
      <block id="41003004" type="v">And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</block>
      <block id="41003005" type="v">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</block>
      <block id="41003006" type="v">And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</block>
      <block id="41003007" type="v">But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</block>
      <block id="41003008" type="v">And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</block>
      <block id="41003009" type="v">And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</block>
      <block id="41003010" type="v">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</block>
      <block id="41003011" type="v">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</block>
      <block id="41003012" type="v">And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</block>
      <block id="41003013" type="v">And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</block>
      <block id="41003014" type="v">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</block>
      <block id="41003015" type="v">And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</block>
      <block id="41003016" type="v">And Simon he surnamed Peter;</block>
      <block id="41003017" type="v">And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</block>
      <block id="41003018" type="v">And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</block>
      <block id="41003019" type="v">And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</block>
      <block id="41003020" type="v">And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</block>
      <block id="41003021" type="v">And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</block>
      <block id="41003022" type="v">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</block>
      <block id="41003023" type="v">And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</block>
      <block id="41003024" type="v">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</block>
      <block id="41003025" type="v">And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</block>
      <block id="41003026" type="v">And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</block>
      <block id="41003027" type="v">No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</block>
      <block id="41003028" type="v">Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</block>
      <block id="41003029" type="v">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</block>
      <block id="41003030" type="v">Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</block>
      <block id="41003031" type="v">There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</block>
      <block id="41003032" type="v">And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</block>
      <block id="41003033" type="v">And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</block>
      <block id="41003034" type="v">And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</block>
      <block id="41003035" type="v">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="41004">
      <block id="41004001" type="v">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</block>
      <block id="41004002" type="v">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</block>
      <block id="41004003" type="v">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</block>
      <block id="41004004" type="v">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</block>
      <block id="41004005" type="v">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</block>
      <block id="41004006" type="v">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</block>
      <block id="41004007" type="v">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</block>
      <block id="41004008" type="v">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</block>
      <block id="41004009" type="v">And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</block>
      <block id="41004010" type="v">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</block>
      <block id="41004011" type="v">And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</block>
      <block id="41004012" type="v">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</block>
      <block id="41004013" type="v">And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</block>
      <block id="41004014" type="v">The sower soweth the word.</block>
      <block id="41004015" type="v">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</block>
      <block id="41004016" type="v">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</block>
      <block id="41004017" type="v">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</block>
      <block id="41004018" type="v">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</block>
      <block id="41004019" type="v">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</block>
      <block id="41004020" type="v">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</block>
      <block id="41004021" type="v">And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</block>
      <block id="41004022" type="v">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</block>
      <block id="41004023" type="v">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</block>
      <block id="41004024" type="v">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</block>
      <block id="41004025" type="v">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</block>
      <block id="41004026" type="v">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</block>
      <block id="41004027" type="v">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</block>
      <block id="41004028" type="v">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</block>
      <block id="41004029" type="v">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</block>
      <block id="41004030" type="v">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</block>
      <block id="41004031" type="v">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</block>
      <block id="41004032" type="v">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</block>
      <block id="41004033" type="v">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</block>
      <block id="41004034" type="v">But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</block>
      <block id="41004035" type="v">And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</block>
      <block id="41004036" type="v">And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</block>
      <block id="41004037" type="v">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</block>
      <block id="41004038" type="v">And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</block>
      <block id="41004039" type="v">And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</block>
      <block id="41004040" type="v">And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</block>
      <block id="41004041" type="v">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="41005">
      <block id="41005001" type="v">And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</block>
      <block id="41005002" type="v">And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</block>
      <block id="41005003" type="v">Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</block>
      <block id="41005004" type="v">Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</block>
      <block id="41005005" type="v">And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</block>
      <block id="41005006" type="v">But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</block>
      <block id="41005007" type="v">And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</block>
      <block id="41005008" type="v">For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</block>
      <block id="41005009" type="v">And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</block>
      <block id="41005010" type="v">And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</block>
      <block id="41005011" type="v">Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</block>
      <block id="41005012" type="v">And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</block>
      <block id="41005013" type="v">And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</block>
      <block id="41005014" type="v">And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</block>
      <block id="41005015" type="v">And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</block>
      <block id="41005016" type="v">And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</block>
      <block id="41005017" type="v">And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</block>
      <block id="41005018" type="v">And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</block>
      <block id="41005019" type="v">Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</block>
      <block id="41005020" type="v">And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</block>
      <block id="41005021" type="v">And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</block>
      <block id="41005022" type="v">And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</block>
      <block id="41005023" type="v">And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</block>
      <block id="41005024" type="v">And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.</block>
      <block id="41005025" type="v">And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</block>
      <block id="41005026" type="v">And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</block>
      <block id="41005027" type="v">When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</block>
      <block id="41005028" type="v">For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</block>
      <block id="41005029" type="v">And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</block>
      <block id="41005030" type="v">And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</block>
      <block id="41005031" type="v">And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</block>
      <block id="41005032" type="v">And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</block>
      <block id="41005033" type="v">But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</block>
      <block id="41005034" type="v">And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</block>
      <block id="41005035" type="v">While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</block>
      <block id="41005036" type="v">As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</block>
      <block id="41005037" type="v">And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</block>
      <block id="41005038" type="v">And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</block>
      <block id="41005039" type="v">And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</block>
      <block id="41005040" type="v">And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</block>
      <block id="41005041" type="v">And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</block>
      <block id="41005042" type="v">And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</block>
      <block id="41005043" type="v">And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</block>

    <chapter id="41006">
      <block id="41006001" type="v">And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</block>
      <block id="41006002" type="v">And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</block>
      <block id="41006003" type="v">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</block>
      <block id="41006004" type="v">But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</block>
      <block id="41006005" type="v">And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</block>
      <block id="41006006" type="v">And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</block>
      <block id="41006007" type="v">And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</block>
      <block id="41006008" type="v">And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</block>
      <block id="41006009" type="v">But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</block>
      <block id="41006010" type="v">And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</block>
      <block id="41006011" type="v">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</block>
      <block id="41006012" type="v">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</block>
      <block id="41006013" type="v">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</block>
      <block id="41006014" type="v">And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</block>
      <block id="41006015" type="v">Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</block>
      <block id="41006016" type="v">But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</block>
      <block id="41006017" type="v">For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</block>
      <block id="41006018" type="v">For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</block>
      <block id="41006019" type="v">Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</block>
      <block id="41006020" type="v">For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</block>
      <block id="41006021" type="v">And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;</block>
      <block id="41006022" type="v">And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</block>
      <block id="41006023" type="v">And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</block>
      <block id="41006024" type="v">And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</block>
      <block id="41006025" type="v">And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</block>
      <block id="41006026" type="v">And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</block>
      <block id="41006027" type="v">And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</block>
      <block id="41006028" type="v">And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</block>
      <block id="41006029" type="v">And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</block>
      <block id="41006030" type="v">And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</block>
      <block id="41006031" type="v">And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</block>
      <block id="41006032" type="v">And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</block>
      <block id="41006033" type="v">And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</block>
      <block id="41006034" type="v">And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</block>
      <block id="41006035" type="v">And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:</block>
      <block id="41006036" type="v">Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</block>
      <block id="41006037" type="v">He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</block>
      <block id="41006038" type="v">He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</block>
      <block id="41006039" type="v">And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</block>
      <block id="41006040" type="v">And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</block>
      <block id="41006041" type="v">And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</block>
      <block id="41006042" type="v">And they did all eat, and were filled.</block>
      <block id="41006043" type="v">And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</block>
      <block id="41006044" type="v">And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</block>
      <block id="41006045" type="v">And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</block>
      <block id="41006046" type="v">And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</block>
      <block id="41006047" type="v">And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</block>
      <block id="41006048" type="v">And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</block>
      <block id="41006049" type="v">But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</block>
      <block id="41006050" type="v">For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</block>
      <block id="41006051" type="v">And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</block>
      <block id="41006052" type="v">For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</block>
      <block id="41006053" type="v">And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</block>
      <block id="41006054" type="v">And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</block>
      <block id="41006055" type="v">And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</block>
      <block id="41006056" type="v">And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="41007">
      <block id="41007001" type="v">Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</block>
      <block id="41007002" type="v">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</block>
      <block id="41007003" type="v">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</block>
      <block id="41007004" type="v">And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</block>
      <block id="41007005" type="v">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</block>
      <block id="41007006" type="v">He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</block>
      <block id="41007007" type="v">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</block>
      <block id="41007008" type="v">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</block>
      <block id="41007009" type="v">And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</block>
      <block id="41007010" type="v">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</block>
      <block id="41007011" type="v">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</block>
      <block id="41007012" type="v">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</block>
      <block id="41007013" type="v">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</block>
      <block id="41007014" type="v">And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</block>
      <block id="41007015" type="v">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</block>
      <block id="41007016" type="v">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</block>
      <block id="41007017" type="v">And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</block>
      <block id="41007018" type="v">And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</block>
      <block id="41007019" type="v">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</block>
      <block id="41007020" type="v">And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</block>
      <block id="41007021" type="v">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</block>
      <block id="41007022" type="v">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</block>
      <block id="41007023" type="v">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</block>
      <block id="41007024" type="v">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</block>
      <block id="41007025" type="v">For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</block>
      <block id="41007026" type="v">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</block>
      <block id="41007027" type="v">But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</block>
      <block id="41007028" type="v">And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</block>
      <block id="41007029" type="v">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</block>
      <block id="41007030" type="v">And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</block>
      <block id="41007031" type="v">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</block>
      <block id="41007032" type="v">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</block>
      <block id="41007033" type="v">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</block>
      <block id="41007034" type="v">And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</block>
      <block id="41007035" type="v">And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</block>
      <block id="41007036" type="v">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</block>
      <block id="41007037" type="v">And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</block>

    <chapter id="41008">
      <block id="41008001" type="v">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</block>
      <block id="41008002" type="v">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</block>
      <block id="41008003" type="v">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</block>
      <block id="41008004" type="v">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</block>
      <block id="41008005" type="v">And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</block>
      <block id="41008006" type="v">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</block>
      <block id="41008007" type="v">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</block>
      <block id="41008008" type="v">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</block>
      <block id="41008009" type="v">And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</block>
      <block id="41008010" type="v">And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</block>
      <block id="41008011" type="v">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</block>
      <block id="41008012" type="v">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</block>
      <block id="41008013" type="v">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</block>
      <block id="41008014" type="v">Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</block>
      <block id="41008015" type="v">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</block>

      <block id="41012001" type="v">And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</block>
      <block id="41012002" type="v">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</block>
      <block id="41012003" type="v">And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</block>
      <block id="41012004" type="v">And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</block>
      <block id="41012005" type="v">And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</block>
      <block id="41012006" type="v">Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</block>
      <block id="41012007" type="v">But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</block>
      <block id="41012008" type="v">And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</block>
      <block id="41012009" type="v">What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</block>
      <block id="41012010" type="v">And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</block>
      <block id="41012011" type="v">This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</block>
      <block id="41012012" type="v">And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</block>
      <block id="41012013" type="v">And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</block>
      <block id="41012014" type="v">And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</block>
      <block id="41012015" type="v">Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</block>
      <block id="41012016" type="v">And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</block>
      <block id="41012017" type="v">And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</block>
      <block id="41012018" type="v">Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</block>
      <block id="41012019" type="v">Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</block>
      <block id="41012020" type="v">Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</block>
      <block id="41012021" type="v">And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</block>
      <block id="41012022" type="v">And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</block>
      <block id="41012023" type="v">In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</block>
      <block id="41012024" type="v">And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</block>
      <block id="41012025" type="v">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</block>
      <block id="41012026" type="v">And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</block>
      <block id="41012027" type="v">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</block>
      <block id="41012028" type="v">And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</block>
      <block id="41012029" type="v">And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</block>
      <block id="41012030" type="v">And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</block>
      <block id="41012031" type="v">And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</block>
      <block id="41012032" type="v">And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</block>
      <block id="41012033" type="v">And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</block>
      <block id="41012034" type="v">And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</block>
      <block id="41012035" type="v">And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</block>
      <block id="41012036" type="v">For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</block>
      <block id="41012037" type="v">David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</block>
      <block id="41012038" type="v">And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,</block>
      <block id="41012039" type="v">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</block>
      <block id="41012040" type="v">Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</block>
      <block id="41012041" type="v">And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</block>
      <block id="41012042" type="v">And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</block>
      <block id="41012043" type="v">And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</block>
      <block id="41012044" type="v">For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</block>

    <chapter id="41013">
      <block id="41013001" type="v">And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</block>
      <block id="41013002" type="v">And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</block>
      <block id="41013003" type="v">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</block>
      <block id="41013004" type="v">Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</block>
      <block id="41013005" type="v">And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:</block>
      <block id="41013006" type="v">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</block>
      <block id="41013007" type="v">And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</block>
      <block id="41013008" type="v">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</block>
      <block id="41013009" type="v">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</block>
      <block id="41013010" type="v">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</block>
      <block id="41013011" type="v">But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</block>
      <block id="41013012" type="v">Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</block>
      <block id="41013013" type="v">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</block>
      <block id="41013014" type="v">But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</block>
      <block id="41013015" type="v">And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:</block>
      <block id="41013016" type="v">And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</block>
      <block id="41013017" type="v">But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</block>
      <block id="41013018" type="v">And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.</block>
      <block id="41013019" type="v">For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</block>
      <block id="41013020" type="v">And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</block>
      <block id="41013021" type="v">And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:</block>
      <block id="41013022" type="v">For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</block>
      <block id="41013023" type="v">But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</block>
      <block id="41013024" type="v">But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</block>
      <block id="41013025" type="v">And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</block>
      <block id="41013026" type="v">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</block>
      <block id="41013027" type="v">And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</block>
      <block id="41013028" type="v">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:</block>
      <block id="41013029" type="v">So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.</block>
      <block id="41013030" type="v">Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.</block>
      <block id="41013031" type="v">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</block>
      <block id="41013032" type="v">But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</block>
      <block id="41013033" type="v">Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.</block>
      <block id="41013034" type="v">For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</block>
      <block id="41013035" type="v">Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:</block>

      <block id="41014001" type="v">After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</block>
      <block id="41014002" type="v">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</block>
      <block id="41014003" type="v">And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</block>
      <block id="41014004" type="v">And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</block>
      <block id="41014005" type="v">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</block>
      <block id="41014006" type="v">And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</block>
      <block id="41014007" type="v">For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</block>
      <block id="41014008" type="v">She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</block>
      <block id="41014009" type="v">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</block>
      <block id="41014010" type="v">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</block>
      <block id="41014011" type="v">And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</block>
      <block id="41014012" type="v">And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</block>
      <block id="41014013" type="v">And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</block>
      <block id="41014014" type="v">And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</block>
      <block id="41014015" type="v">And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</block>
      <block id="41014016" type="v">And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</block>
      <block id="41014017" type="v">And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</block>
      <block id="41014018" type="v">And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</block>
      <block id="41014019" type="v">And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</block>
      <block id="41014020" type="v">And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</block>
      <block id="41014021" type="v">The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</block>
      <block id="41014022" type="v">And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</block>
      <block id="41014023" type="v">And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</block>
      <block id="41014024" type="v">And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</block>
      <block id="41014025" type="v">Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</block>

      <block id="41014027" type="v">And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</block>

      <block id="41014029" type="v">But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</block>
      <block id="41014030" type="v">And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</block>
      <block id="41014031" type="v">But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</block>
      <block id="41014032" type="v">And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</block>
      <block id="41014033" type="v">And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</block>
      <block id="41014034" type="v">And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</block>
      <block id="41014035" type="v">And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</block>
      <block id="41014036" type="v">And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</block>
      <block id="41014037" type="v">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</block>
      <block id="41014038" type="v">Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</block>
      <block id="41014039" type="v">And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</block>
      <block id="41014040" type="v">And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</block>
      <block id="41014041" type="v">And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</block>
      <block id="41014042" type="v">Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</block>
      <block id="41014043" type="v">And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</block>
      <block id="41014044" type="v">And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</block>
      <block id="41014045" type="v">And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</block>
      <block id="41014046" type="v">And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</block>
      <block id="41014047" type="v">And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</block>
      <block id="41014048" type="v">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</block>
      <block id="41014049" type="v">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</block>
      <block id="41014050" type="v">And they all forsook him, and fled.</block>
      <block id="41014051" type="v">And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</block>

      <block id="41014053" type="v">And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</block>
      <block id="41014054" type="v">And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</block>
      <block id="41014055" type="v">And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</block>
      <block id="41014056" type="v">For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</block>
      <block id="41014057" type="v">And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</block>
      <block id="41014058" type="v">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</block>
      <block id="41014059" type="v">But neither so did their witness agree together.</block>
      <block id="41014060" type="v">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</block>
      <block id="41014061" type="v">But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</block>
      <block id="41014062" type="v">And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</block>
      <block id="41014063" type="v">Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</block>
      <block id="41014064" type="v">Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</block>
      <block id="41014065" type="v">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</block>
      <block id="41014066" type="v">And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</block>
      <block id="41014067" type="v">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</block>
      <block id="41014068" type="v">But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</block>
      <block id="41014069" type="v">And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</block>
      <block id="41014070" type="v">And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</block>
      <block id="41014071" type="v">But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</block>
      <block id="41014072" type="v">And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</block>

    <chapter id="41015">
      <block id="41015001" type="v">And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</block>
      <block id="41015002" type="v">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</block>
      <block id="41015003" type="v">And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</block>
      <block id="41015004" type="v">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</block>
      <block id="41015005" type="v">But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</block>
      <block id="41015006" type="v">Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</block>
      <block id="41015007" type="v">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</block>
      <block id="41015008" type="v">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</block>
      <block id="41015009" type="v">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</block>
      <block id="41015010" type="v">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</block>
      <block id="41015011" type="v">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</block>
      <block id="41015012" type="v">And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</block>
      <block id="41015013" type="v">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</block>
      <block id="41015014" type="v">Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</block>
      <block id="41015015" type="v">And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</block>
      <block id="41015016" type="v">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</block>
      <block id="41015017" type="v">And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</block>
      <block id="41015018" type="v">And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</block>
      <block id="41015019" type="v">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</block>
      <block id="41015020" type="v">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</block>
      <block id="41015021" type="v">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</block>
      <block id="41015022" type="v">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</block>
      <block id="41015023" type="v">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</block>
      <block id="41015024" type="v">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</block>
      <block id="41015025" type="v">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</block>
      <block id="41015026" type="v">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</block>
      <block id="41015027" type="v">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</block>
      <block id="41015028" type="v">And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</block>
      <block id="41015029" type="v">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</block>
      <block id="41015030" type="v">Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</block>
      <block id="41015031" type="v">Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</block>
      <block id="41015032" type="v">Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</block>
      <block id="41015033" type="v">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</block>
      <block id="41015034" type="v">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</block>
      <block id="41015035" type="v">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</block>
      <block id="41015036" type="v">And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</block>
      <block id="41015037" type="v">And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</block>
      <block id="41015038" type="v">And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</block>
      <block id="41015039" type="v">And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</block>
      <block id="41015040" type="v">There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</block>
      <block id="41015041" type="v">Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</block>
      <block id="41015042" type="v">And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</block>
      <block id="41015043" type="v">Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</block>
      <block id="41015044" type="v">And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</block>
      <block id="41015045" type="v">And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</block>
      <block id="41015046" type="v">And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</block>
      <block id="41015047" type="v">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</block>
    </chapter>
    <chapter id="41016">
      <block id="41016001" type="v">And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</block>
      <block id="41016002" type="v">And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</block>
      <block id="41016003" type="v">And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</block>
      <block id="41016004" type="v">And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</block>
      <block id="41016005" type="v">And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</block>
      <block id="41016006" type="v">And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</block>
      <block id="41016007" type="v">But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</block>
      <block id="41016008" type="v">And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</block>
      <block id="41016009" type="v">Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</block>
      <block id="41016010" type="v">And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</block>
      <block id="41016011" type="v">And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</block>
      <block id="41016012" type="v">After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</block>
      <block id="41016013" type="v">And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</block>
      <block id="41016014" type="v">Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</block>
      <block id="41016015" type="v">And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</block>
      <block id="41016016" type="v">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</block>
      <block id="41016017" type="v">And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</block>
      <block id="41016018" type="v">They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</block>
      <block id="41016019" type="v">So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</block>
      <block id="41016020" type="v">And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</block>
